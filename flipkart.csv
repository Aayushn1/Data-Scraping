Digisol DG-HR3400 Router :
0 Awesome range in Home & But u put nearear the Galary of your Home it's outside home range is too Good.Must Buy This product.Price is Good.
1 brought it a month ago..signal is not regular..need to connect and disconnect many times..totally disappointing..don't go for it
2 wifi range of this router is excellent.... and the build quality is superb...... my all 3 floored building is fully covered by this....
3 When asked my friend, shall i buy digisol router his reaction was its local dude, because its made in india and for TP link he says wow because it is made in china,, but trust me guys this product is too good and small and compatible which deliver good output and speed and network covers upto 2 floor house... The people mindset of Made in India is local should be changed until then we are digging grave for our economy to cheap Chinese product Only suggestion can make to digisol is it more l...
4 Had second thoughts about getting this router since it had limited reviews. Placed the order anyway and they took a good 5 days to deliver to product (Router came all the way from Mumbai) and it was worth the wait.(Recently moved from BSNL to ACT fibernet) Pros:+ Compact, sleek and lightweight with matte black finish.+ Easy to configure (Barely took 5 minutes) (CD Provided)+ Dual +5dB antenna provides around 35 feet coverage through 4 thick walls.+ Compatible with ACT Broadband (No more...
5 Its very good for me. Signal is strength.
6 Nice product for this price. Gud product.
7 Good product and configuration is very simple and easily available on the Internet in case you find it difficult to configure. Overall very satisfied with the product.
8 DG HR3400 :* BEST Range Arround 35ft. Dia. Cause 5dbi dual antenna* 300 mbps but good enough transfer rate for india.* Best buy @990rs.* Easy to setup. In 5-10 mins.* RJ-45 ethernet port supported. In the end best Buy worth for money.
9 Its not branded like d-link or tp-link but its useful similarly, and more over its India made and had a good network coverage and works perfectly...!!Its doesnot costs much but works perfectly...!!To setup for first time you have to call the toll free no.:1800 209 3444 and follow the AI instruction to setup the router....and thats all ...!!
10 perfect cheej
11 Best thing is that we can use as wifi range extender and repeater
12 Digisol rock on..after also a thunder storm in which my pc got a huge problem but the router is just like Usain Bolt.Extra surprice that it comes with lifetime warranty
13 mast h bhai good coverage setup me thoda problem but overall best good singal of wifi........................
14 I Purchased This A Week Ago From Another Website.It Came With Transparent Sealed Poly Layer Over The Box & Digisol Official Seal On The Opening Of Box.STORY-1st Day, When I Configured It & Start Using It, I've Selected 9th Channel In Wireless Network Setting.I GOT SHOCKED WHEN I GOT 55% RADAR ON A SPOT 110-120 METERS AWAY FROM HOME.2nd Day, When I Adjusted Time & Date Of Router, The AP Was Not Even Discoverable On The Same Last Night's Position.SOLUTION-After A Long Study Of 30mins...
15 Amazing router !! I am using it with my alliance broadband !! I have got amazing speed with amazing range !! I am humble enough on both Flipkart & Digisol !! It has two problems i) heating issue & ii) Difficult to configure !! but these are negotiable !! Overall its a value for money product
16 If you are looking for a home router, this is the best, i have seen! I have used Dlink dir-600 one, a Tp-link one but believe me I just loved this!This has WPS function(unlike Dlink) , a great network coverage ('strong' network upto 2 floors) and the best part It's size! Cutest router I have seen!
17 Well, I purchased the product a couple of months ago, but now am doing a review on it concerning its overall performance after having tested it for two months. Mind you, it's an Indian manufactured device, yet I'm completely impressed with its range and performance given its price tag as against its expensive counterparts of other brands. I've only tested it in some areas such as: signal strength, range, connectivity and so on - everything is on a par. Haven't tested it in an apartment as I l...
18 I bought this product looking at nice review and ratings. But It's a horrible local product with bad customer support. Worked fine for a month and I was happy that Indian manufacturers can compete with international brands. But Alas! After a month, there was regular interruption in connection and I had to restart the router 20-30 times a day. No kidding. When i reverted to my old router, everything is working perfectly fine. I don't bet my money on this desi cow dung. Beware of this cheapo pr...
19 wifi range of this router is excellent.... and the build quality is superb...... my all house full cover and best price and best quality .. awesome product....easy setup ....it is best router..... am happy buy this router
20 Firstly thanks to Flipkart for good packing and in time delivery. It's been a month that I purchased Digisol router. Till date there is no issue at all. Works perfectly fine.Pros:1) Slim and weightless.2) Design is good.3) Wide range. No signal drops at any corner of the house(1800sft).4) Has two 5dbi antenna's and provides full signal strength.4) Quick and easy installation process. Hardly took 5min to complete the flow.5) Act Fiber + Digisol = Perfect combination. Works awesome with...
21 Ordered the item on 5th and got on 6th thanks to flipkart.Now about the Routerawesome product small compact covers my whole 2000 Sq ft flat.clear signal in every room.This is my 3rd Digisol product and i must say Digisol is making me coming back for more.

40 I am an ethernet engineer and i was looking for a router for ftth line i have & at times use the router in wifi AP mode. Purchased it for ₹848 on discount from flipkart. Its a good option considering it has 4 addl ethernet ports @100mbps full duplex speeds so that can serve as expansion. For the price its not a bad deal but the only disappointing thing is the build quality. Its built around cheap plastic, the physical power button is a push type & the spring has uneven response. Some times ...

152 Thank you fiipcart
153 mead in India products
154 Good
155 Best router in this price range, just go for it. Easy and hassle free installation. Connectivity range is also good.
156 router URL, page not found
157 Used it for about 1.5 years and now its range has been very low now. The greatest irony is that they dont have any physical customer care center anywhere in India, they only support you via call and you cannot get it repaired or replaced anyway
158 Using since more than a year now. Good signals reception within 50metres area. Signal strength is also good when there are multiple walls in between as well. Double antenna does its job and no issues faced while connecting more than 5 devices at same time.
159 It is a pretty good router. Didn't have any problems with it and it has been more than a year. I recommend it. • But if you want a higher security router, this is not the one for you as it can be hacked by any of the hacking apps out there.
160 Awesome quality. Speed awesome
161 good
162 I bought this product and its working very slow.. Always gets disconnected.
163 Liked my old Digisol 3g router to this one. That was good. This is ok.
164 Oh its incridible product, range are so pretty.  If you buy good and best quality router then go for it without any hesitation beacuase me and my whole family circle and all of my friends use this product, just talk owwoooaaa products made by India....thanks Indian developer for build this best product...

183 Tq Flipkart
184 Good one..
185 Im using it nearly 2 years nowand it's really good.
186 Product is good for coverage in WiFi. Nd easily setup for Jio WiFi Nd mobile hotspot.Nice product
187 I am using the router as repeater the connectivity is okay not so great it is good to use it as a main router...
188 Needs to be restarted atleast twice a day Same was the case with my TP link router.
189 Value for money. Great product at this price. WiFi speed is and router size is compact and good looking.
190 good working long distance
191 Best class router .. easy setup.. good renge..
192 The router is fine. It is so compact. Small sized. Less weight. No heating problems. Connecting to the net is fast. Range is good. It would be better if you keep the router in the middle part of your house. Speed is the same. I saw a comment earlier that this router boosted the speed. But the speed remains the same.Anyway it is a good router under 1000rs. If you are looking for a budget router go for it.
193 good quality product...full satisfied
194 Good
195 Excellent router for this rate wow awsome range through wifi signal must buy who have use broadband connection up tp 50-100mbps speed plz use this router superb product thankyou flipkart everytime u give the trusted products..thank you so much

210 Nice product working properly
211 superb product by digisol..
212 This product works awesome. Good range. Works as expected. Worth for the money
213 Although at this price point I didn't expected anything like this. But this router delivers what exactly I was expecting from it.Covers a wide range (of course a double antenna router must have it) which almost completely covers my whole 2 floor building with it's signal.Provide high-speed connection.I'm writing this review after 2 year from purchase and till now I didn't received any problem from it. And it was only turned off when there was a power cut :D

226 one of the most handy and a must for the broadband lovers. Very good quality its been almost 1 year since i bought this, yes i know i am writing the review now but its worth it.
227 Super duper range & speed n nice product
228 Risetechnology given me November 2016 manufacturing product ... Today 17/08/2017... So bill,packing, product quality ok ....
229 Works just fine.
230 Poor network capturng quality
231 Modem technology is supposedly mature and it just has to sit and do its job.Which *drumroll* it does not, 1st one stopped working within 3 months , requested a warranty claim for which they supplied a refurbished item and that has connectivity issues from the first week of replacement.I'm done with this ,will just go back to  some of the well established brands in this segment.so much for make in India.
232 Don't the problem!!!!!Unable to install it..My bucks seem to be gone..at last able to install it but coverage area is not that so it claimed.
233 Nice product in such a reasonable price...
234 Nice  and speed awesome very good product
235 Gud product
236 Very nice
237 Nice
238 The router is very good. The build quality is very good and the silver lining is the lifetime warranty. The range is too good, specially if there are very little walls in between the router and the recipient. In case there are two or three walls, the reception drops considerably but with a single wall, the range is phenomenal
239 Very Good product at Reasonable price . ☺☺☺☺
240 Good product at this price...
241 Router speed is so good I like that
242 Really awesome
243 Good quality. Value for money. Great product

253 Very Nice Product!
254 Is a chota packet bada dhamaka!Extremely small in size.Range reaches every corner of my 2 BHK flat,  including a room separated by double walls.
255 Good
256 Thanks Flipkart .great product work's well
257 Range is not as expected even though there is two antennas....
258 One of the worst router's out there. 1. The wifi stops broadcasting automatically and I have to restart it manually to make it come back up.2. When I connect my laptop via a lan cable coming through the router, after some time the internet stops working and I have to restart it.3. My Internet speed is almost 6MBps but this router can't even provide me with a decent 1MBps most of the time.My suggestion will be that don't ever buy this router!
259 Very good product for home router ..for 1 bhk range..after 4 months it's working in same manner..good to buy it..
260 Good works till now only the blicking light turned off...
261 Good WiFi signal strength up to 2nd floor it has no problem

300 Super
301 Appreciate product
302 Am awesome buy... Great signal strength all over my 3-storeyed house.. And commendable delivery service by ekart..
303 Very poor performance. Not good in compare of other model like TPLink and D-Link.
304 not working now. it is trash after one year.
305 Great WiFi router with excellent range
306 Good ...Not a bad working .....
307 Good service of delivery. thanks Flipkart.but product is very bad,never buy it.
308 Its a great experience as off now, no issue with speed or connectivity.Good product.
309 Good
310 Its a great experience as off now, no issue with speed or connectivity.At the begining i was not able to setup, but i applied my knowledge which i gathered while working for BT(British Telecom). For cable broadband we need to select static IP and not PPPoA.Any way its working fine for me in my 1 and half BHK flat.
311 excellent product.works great, easily installed and very helpful customet service by digisol.totally satisfied with the router
312 nice product.....i use this product.....very satisfying
313 Very compact in size but still works like a charm. Has a full signal at every corner of a 900 sqft. 1 bhk flat. Though, at times it stops transmitting (kindly note this is only post 15-16 hours of if being on). A simple restarting of the modem gets it back on track. Boot time is also extremely good. This one's worth investing into. :)Oh, and prompt delivery from Flipkart.
314 Probably,the best router I have used ever.Signal strength of this Digisol router is tooo strong .I think that is one of the best budget router in this price.
315 Good for use in home...
316 Not good
317 Worth buying....Like it very much
318 Nice....
319 Good product and worth of it. I brought this Rs799 . Entire three floor covering .
320 I've been using it for 1 year. no problem until now.

325 Amaing product.Easy to set it up..great connection..very wide range.
326 Flipkart as always awesome
327 Excellent coverage of my home. Better than tplink. Great buy. Recommended..!
328 it is working slightly
329 Very nice product
330 Used it for a year.However a lightning incident took away my favourite router.The most sought after Router.Both I and my friend had this.He is still using .No issues. Our cable operator also sells the same router for more price. Signal Strength is great.Easy to setup.I used TPLINK too. My operator told complaints are much lesser for DIGISOL when it compares to TPLINK , DLINK or NETGEAR.This company is doing a great job.Anyway TP link compared to this is nothing.
331 Good one
332 It is working absolutely fine no problem till now.

418 Excellent quality. Works perfectly well. I have both  HR1400 and HR3400.  Both are excellent.Both are very easy to configure and manual is simple to understand. Ideal for home use or small office use. No need to spend money on expensive products as this gives same quality. Happy to know it is  made in India.
419 Had a bit issues during installation but has been working well 24x7 and is even giving signals at some spots 4 floors below our flat
420 Setup the router as repeater, getting great coverage so far. Documentation on the digisol website was easy to use for setting up the router. Has wall mount capability as well.
421 Average
422 Good
423 Good product..specialy its indian product so i give first preferred..thanks digisoul & flipkart
424 My 100 Mbps connection was earlier showing a speed of 25 Mbps . After changing the router to this digisol one the speeds shown are 45+ Mbps . A small let down was in the expectations of increasing the range which didn't happen even with two antenna . But definitely a good product for home use .
425 Value for money.. installing and setting up process is very simple.. light weight and hood quality material.. good signal strength and speed
426 Awesome for small range use...but for better range, preffer different product with higher price.

433 The product didn't last too long but it was replaced by the service centre within 5 days. Unfortunately they only replace with refurbished units and not an entirely new piece. But the replacement has been working fine since. The product on the other hand is simple to use and easy to setup and has decent range.

469 Nice
470 Not a good product! Though the set up was easy,  wi fi strength is very poor. My earlier router was from belkin and it provided network in every room of my 1100 sqft flat whereas Digisol DG HR3400 can only provide good network only in the adjacent room.

528 Firstly thanks to Flipkart for good packing and in time delivery. It's been two or three months that I purchased Digisol DG-HR3400 router. Till date there is no issue at all. Works perfectly fine. Pros:+ Compact, sleek and lightweight with matte black finish.+ Easy to configure (Barely took 5 minutes) (CD Provided)+ Dual 5dB antenna provides around 35 feet coverage through 4 thick walls.+ Compatible with ACT Broadband (No more logging in every time, Router does it for you)+ Has power O...
529 Excellent router in good budget . Good range, purchased on 23 April 16 delivered on 27 April. Buy it
530 I am using the item for more than a month. It is a router without modem. I am using it within 30 ft range the performance is awesome. I am multiple gadgets with it without any hastle. The top light is not at all disturbing as said by one buyer before my purchase. So just go for it. It truly pay u back by its performance. I have recommended my friends to buy it.
531 Love it, simply toooo good the range is excellent, the Wi-Fi router is located next to my TV and i use Wi-Fi from my room, signal strength is 3 signals, really a very nice router
532 wifi range of this router is excellent ...................................fully satisfied . very nice modem for home .
533 This is a very well designed router with dual high gain antennae.The web management page at 192.168.2.1 gives plenty of details and parameters to fine tune.Also has a feature to upgrade firmware.Has good range, better than my previous Netgear WNR614.Also has a dedicated on/off button (absent on my previous router) and WPS button.Last but not least, I purchased it after reading so many positive reviews about a 'Made in India' product.And those positive reviews indeed turned out to be true.
534 Very Sleek and compact device with good WIFI speed, and you know what it has life time warranty, Made in India, it has got all you need
535 After seen this digisol router on friend's house..... I ordered it.... Its delivery was done in 4 days....I would say it's the best , it's range is good around 30mts(3 walls)....80+ (side of window)..I keep it on for 10-12 hrs everyday,, sometime even whole day and night....Never occurred any problem, installing easy....And a life time warranty...and made in indiaWhat u want other than that....edit 1: Even after 4 months of daily use....not a single problem seen....
536 Good value for money, excellent range, and quality of connection.Covers a 1200sq feet area. Made in India... :-)
537 Besttttt Router in This Range Really Great Router For me Thank you Flipkart
538 i purchased this product a week ago and i am just love with this product...........excellent performance, very good quality and 100% genuine product......... thankyou flipkart
539 It has two antennas so provide good range on same floor but if you intend to use on two floors it may not provide full range on both floors. On other floor it will provide range but on limited scale (in one or two room may be). Overall very good product working smooth without any interruptions.
540 Bought this product at 900rs, setting up & configuring was very easy. Signal strength is really good and stable. Most of the time product remains switched on for few days, both adapter as well as router never gets near to warm after even fews days heavy long usage.Those who are not getting good stable signal consider bending left antenna a little bit back then left as well as right antenna little bit back and right such than if u draw an imaginary line it will look like an 'X' with point of...
541 Used it for 5 months and its working very good. Its a pocket friendly router and without comprising on anything. Good range. The router is kept on the ground flour and I get 2-3 bars of signal on the 1st floor. Even on 2nd floor u get fluctuating signal but its hardly 1 bar. Just Go for it. Just need to install once on ur PC ( which is using the cable internet)â?? after that login to your service provider account from any device using wifi.
542 Awesome Router..wifi range of this router is excellent.... and the build quality is superb...... my all 3 floored building is fully covered by this....
543 Its is really a Good Product, Worth every penny. Make sure to connect as per the instructions, and it works good.
544 easy to install, good build.however the twin towers are not that effective. couldnt get reception in all rooms of my 3 bhk, however serves more than the intended purpose at this price range.
545 I have briefly used this router when my Asus RT-N13UB1 went kaput. I was amazed how strong the signal is!!! No router even the TP Link 841 is not a match! Now Im using the Asus RT-N14UHP and ill say its more than a match for the Asus ( three 9Dbi antenna) in terms of signal strength and yes Im not joking here. Buy it Seriously.
546 Product works awesome. Configuration is well explained in the manual, took 10 min to configure. Signal strength and bandwidth is very good. I have compared with Netgear and TP link. Digisol is better than these.
547 I'm using this product and very happy with it. easy to set up and start using WiFi. The price is also very good & in budget. Best WiFi router for 2 to 3 Bedroom house.
548 Have been using this for 5 months now, its working perfect.. powerful WiFi signal.I would recommend this product..just go for it.
549 I am fully satisfied with the router. Its great working in a 3 floor building any where without any problem neither with speed or signal.Thanks digisol, thanks to the seller tahkub and finally flipkart..
550 Works well with local net provider. no need of extra modem. Worth the money. Been using it from 3 months, I haven't faced any problems so far. Can connect more than 10 devices at a time.
551 This Router Is Good But How To Port Forward This Router ??  anybody know Bcz I have Create gaming Server.......
552 I have been using this product since the last 2 months. The best signal range at this price-signal strength full outside my house. Last month due to thunderstorm, the router got damaged. I called up the toll-free number, they told me to send the router to the nearby DIGISOL retailer. After 1 week they returned the router, fully new one :) LIFETIME WARRANTY makes this thing awesome!
553 Hi,   The product is good and wifi signal strength is also good.I doubt if the wifi bandwidth is really 300Mbps. At times the bandwidth is pretty impressive.At times it goes very log, i dont know why. Buy Indian...!
554 I bought this product after reading all the reviewes but disappointed.. Because transmission signal is very poor, think twice before u buy this product.
555 Covers my ground floor,1st floor and 2nd floor.Two 5dbi antenas provides maximum signal strength.less heating provides maximum security. outstanding product
556 Pro: I bought this router specifically to address the issue of weak signal in my son's room across the hall. Perfect decision, as there is excellent reception there. The signal drops drastically, though, when I move to further corners of my apartment. Too many walls to contend with, perhaps? Anyway, quite satisfied with the buy, especially for the sub-1K price for a 300 MBPS Dual-Antenna one. The build is quite good too.Cons: The setup. I have had three routers before this, and setup-wise, ...
557 Look buyers I am absolutely honest with you. This router is undoubtedly good at everything.First time I have made an intense search on various routers but lastly I choose this router after so many searches. I got a contradiction on choosing TP-link wr841, D-Link 605L and this Digisol Hr3400.After choosing this particular one I am extremely happy with its performance, range and signal strength.Some of my friends have TP-link wr841, D-Link 605L but Digisol router has more signal strength and...
558 i used it for more than 10 days and i am not facing sort of issues so far . but i have a one minor problem i'm currently using rail wire broadband internet the speed is 10 Mbps . The problem i'm facing is when i reach at far end of the signal at one bar the speed decreases to 10:1 , i mean speed is redduced 1 mbps at the lower range of wifi .
559 Nice router, delivered fast. I was expecting more range from device but it is not.I can say that worth to buy it.
560 very quick delivery . product working contions is very cool n good. quick install.wide range wifi signals. thankyou flipkart team
561 CHEAP AND GOOD QUALITY. LATEST MODEM VERSION 2. GO FOR IT. AMAZING PRODUCT. BEST THING IS THAT IT IS MADE IN INDIA.
562 Its a good product. i am not facing any issue with signal & disconnection. I will suggest it to my friends also.
563 Most bad
564 plez guys don't buy from this seller he is totally froad. i had got wrong product and after that i had done 3 time replacement and every time he send wrong product...becoz of seller didn't have original product ...Flipkart  communication service is very very poor with seller. they send again and again wrong product even i clearly mention this matter. i had done 13-15 customer care call but no resultreally this time i feel very bad against to Flipkart
565 I am using Asianet digital modem. Wanted to have multiple device connected and hence tried the Router. It worked fine the first time. Then will not connect to internet unless I unplug and plug the power of the router unit. But it drops the connection again once powered off. The support team (smart link) helped but could not solve the issue and advised to return the product. Raised a return request with flipkart (delivered on April 2nd). Would be great if I can get a refund but not clear what ...

578 Courier details are not mentioned
579 Can it work with the airtel,Aircel,Reliance; Vodafone connections
580 The performance doesn't meet the expectations. My internet speed is 50 mbps when I am connected wired but wireless with this router I get 25 to 30 Mbps only. Really disappointing.
581 Your service is very good...
582 Thank u got on time
583 Fastest Delivery Ever.
584 Thanks a lot flipcart your service is too good and safe and secure flipcart
585 Very fast delivery...

595 Delivery was before time
596 Ekhi Baat Kehna Hai.....“Just Awesome” Product..
597 this product is good but delevery service is bad it came to me 1 week later of date. this is worst service
598 good product, working good ,,, no problem at all.. over all happy.. only issues was packing was not up to mark.. but advise other to buy it without hesitation.. worth of money spent
599 Best WIFI router ever. Proud to use and see an Indian productPros:  Range is decent, 300 MB/s, Lifetime warranty.
600 Very good product. bought it recently. Digisol online helpline centre helped a lot in installing. no need to call the cable guy. Just call in online number for installation. Flipkart delivery was very good. well packed.
601 his router is very easy to configure with a cd that comes with it. I configured my Tikona connection and it works fine. Many people have a question whether this router works with tikona broadband. I configured PPPOE mode and no need to enter username and password everytime I connect. so works well. Speed is good but I have 1 BHK flat and I have kept router in Living room. in bedroom, signal is very poor. Even after having 2 antennas didn't expect this signal
602 This very Worst Worst Product ...Also no help from service  centre and Flipkrt also.All are Cheaters...
603 so far very good serving my purpose very well and very easy to install and set up very nice Flipkart service is also very good thanks
604 Received TAMPERED box. The seal was open an the box seems like broken. The packing was not up to mark as Flipkart used to do. The product was not like new. I am totally not satisfied with it.
605 When i have seen, it was mentioned that price is 3990,71% discount, but after i got this product...Price was mentioned 1990. This is 2nd time i suffered from flipkart. In fact paid 100 for delivery..Bullshit/
606 Bough this product specially for Repeater mode. Good Range. Requires  setting - first time little frustrating. Do got through Manual for setting.In Repeater  Mode, Advance settings  will nit be enabled  and available for configuration such as  MAC Filtering, URL Blocking, etc. "Warranty" seal  on the  base of the product, which I received is already tampered/broken. DO have a look on this issue and  let me know how my warranty will be covered/offered. now.Do check these things before ...
607 i never recommended any one to buy this product ... i think in compression of this TP Link is best ................................................................................................................................................................
608 One of the waste product what i have purchased. Costumer service is one of the dumpiest service in the word. After purchase with 2 to 3 months it stop working.
609 I could not connect the instrument since there was NO PATCH CORD supplied along with this packing, although same was included in the packing list.
610 Why the image shown on the box is different from the product shown outside the box?
611 Product of digisol is above average but the delivery from flipkart is worst and made me to give 1 star. I ordered this product on 12th of august and it meant to be delivered on 16th, on 16th i received sms that our for delivery within an hour received another message saying rejected by customer though didn't receive any call or visit at my address, then i chased back to flipkart what is all happening, they promised to re deliver to the next day and you wouldn't believe the same thing repeated...
612 what are software version this model ?? ...............................................................................................................................
613 The product is working awesome, but the packaging done was not at all near to being professional     (NO FLIPKART BOX EVEN, JUST WRAPPED UP IN A YELLOW PAPER), and the product received by me also had its seal already tampered ( ACTUALLY BROKEN) . I sincerely wanted to complain and replace the product receiving it in this condition, but after checking the product's performance, I settled with it, in-order to avoid the hassle and the delay which would be caused in due procedure. THIS IS THE FIR...
614 I'm not satisfied with this product... its stopping everytime and i need to restart it a lot.I will not recommend this product to any friendI even tried to return back this one, but the flipkart messaged me 4-5 times that ''we tried to contact u many times, but u r unavailable'' then they messaged that ''we think u r satisfied with the product, so we are cancelling the return'' . OH GOD..
615 Flipkart commitment me for replacing the faulty item but still now not pickup my faulty item.  After waiting 10 days i understand that flipkart service is very bad
616 I AM HAVING GTPL CONNECTION AND KINDLY LETS KNOW WHETHER THIS ROUTER CAN BE USED FOR GTPL GUJARAT CONNECTION??

1 After going through lot of reviews/feedbacks, I come across this one, perfectly suitableDelivery and package was excellent. setup is simple, amazing performance. good range, One of the best out of best feature is it connects just in seconds.I really love this product. best buy
2 Good Product form Digisol Again...Worth for the money & I am satisfied.It has a USB Port & Two Antenna.
3 Using this from few months, so far so good. USB supports flash drives and 1TB HDD as FTP. I have 3 partition in my USB HDD and only one can be detected at a time :(  still i am happy it supports. I recommend this as a good router with USB support. 👍
4 I cant access my hard drive connected to usb port on this router by ftp. Plz show me a proper way to access my hard drive
5 This router works like a charm. For the price I have got it, it's amazing. Connectivity is good, easy to configure, good range. Best part is, for this price, I have my hard connected to this router and I can access it's content over FTP. I no longer require to have external hard drive connected to my system when I want to watch movies nor I have to copy a movie and give hard drive to someone else.I'm yet to try dongle but I'm sure it will work just fine as well.
6 This is a very good quality router with super fast speed & connectivity. Simple installation. Signal strength is very strong even after multiple wall barriers in between.Must have gadget for all the internet lovers using broad-band connection.
7 Good Products
8 Works fine with all the features. But connecting HDD to USB and creating a shared network is not possible
9 Very bad power on off switch.Only within 15days of use, its power switch become loose
10 BEST IN CLASS!!!!!NO OTHER ROUTER CAN BEAT ITS PERFORMANCE, FUNCTIONALITY AND EASE OF USE WITHIN THIS PRICE BRACKET!!#SIGNAL STRENTHcan penetrate up to two 5inch walls or three 3inch walls, depending on distance!#RANGEif placed properly, it'll provide full coverage inside a small 3 storied house/building! IF THE SELLER AIN'T CHEATING YOU, U CAN BLINDLY GO FOR THIS ONE!
11 Its really a very good product by Digisol....It covers my 1200 SFT Flat without any problem. And USB connectivity is also good.I am using this product since more than a year.
12 A good buyAm satisfiedIt has got a usb port tooWhich is an add onPlusMade in IndiaBy Indian firmSwadeshi zindabad
13 Very happy with the performance & the signal strength of the router. I have been using it for a month and I must agree it has lived upto my expectations and Its in Make in India product with no compromise in quality. I would recommend it.Note: Seller took almost 12days to delivery this product which i feel way too much
14 This router doesn't work with Vodafone model ZTE K3770Z & ZTE MF667 have tried a lot with digisol customer care they confirm to me it will not work...Not worth it....Kindly chk with customer care for compatibility of the data card with this router
15 Till last month in my office , my employees were using individual 3G dongles for internet access and due to this our company had to pay a the huge internet bills every month and one day one of friend suggested me a solution  DIGISOL DG-HR3420 300Mbps wireless Broadband cum 4G router and now we have connected only a single 4G dongle on DIGISOL DG-HR3420 router  for internet access after which my internet bills are reduced by amost 50 % every month.I am using Airtel 4G Dongle E3276.
16 ProsGood Range at same floor.Have a restart buttion.Build quality is average.ConsFrequently range drops at lower and upper floor.Those LEDs blow brighter than a table lamp.My router got malfunctioned in 15 days.It does not start in 1 shot. I have to try 15 times daily to start it. Gets switched off anytime. Have to restart frequently. Beware of cheap Indian products specially which are new in market. Bad experience with digisol.
17 I am writing review after successful completion of three years of purchase.  Router is awesome. working good without issues. The power  adapter got damaged after 3years which I had bought for 150 Rs
18 Nice product,  Worth.
19 Range is much better than TP link
20 Was good at beginning.. but service falls after use.. lifetime guarantee is just a dream
21 Best wifi router pan using it from last 2 yrs
22 In mentioned product u will not get warranty if it burned but my router burn in 11 month. Its not worth to buy. Better buy i ball router.
23 It works well and fine from beginning to untill now
24 Don't buy this product very bad
25 > Great product..  Value for money. > Product was delivered on time and neatly packed. > I was specifically looking for a 'Router Only' and not with the modem.  Since this product comes along with a USB port is an added advantage. I have connected a wireless USB Hub to the router and have now connected an External Hard Drive and a printer. The setup works great. > The wireless range is quite good and reaches all the corners of my duplex house.
26 Continuously use this product from last 2 years... no any issue,...its WiFi network long range and the 300 mbps speed, the Indian product which give the lifetime warranty, so  as my opinion is the one of the best product which I use now..
27 Good product at this price
28 Cover my 3 floor nice bear router
29 Good product
30 It is slow performance
31 Awesome
32 Money worth...... Reliable Indian product... No heating issues... I run it 24/7 all days.....
33 Good product
34 Using from 6 months no issues
35 Very good connectivity and signal strength.
36 This is a great router, really good value for money. The installation guide was very helpful. The range is pretty good, as is the speed. It has a USB port too, an added advantage.
37 Its very useful product. and its really excellent. I really appreciate for time to time delivery also.
38 This router doesn't have print server, usb port can only be used for sharing media storage devices like HDD and pendriveYou can't connect a printer to work as a wireless
39 Please explain me, Is it working with Direct BSNL Line, or I have to by a BSNL Modem for this.Because other product also required ADSL Modem for  connecting with wireless router.

0 Super...... Good speed,good signel,thank to flipcart.....
1 Excellent product,network range is outstanding and set up is really easy.very much satisfied...a must buy without any second thought.thank you flipkart and digisol.
2 3rd class category router, each batch has manufacturing defect. please don't buy this waste of money.
3 its very good
4 I bought this device around 2 months ago. worked all good for the first 40 days. And than the wireless range gradually started decreasing. When connected more than 5-6 devices, this device will overload and reboot every now and than. This device cant handle more than 5 device. Wireless Coverage is not more than 10-12 metres even in an open environment. Never again with this brand. Choose D-Link over this brand any-day. .
5 Enough for a 3 bhk flatnice range and high speedi was getting 32 mbps from my connection
6 The range is good for 3 storey building
7 please don't buy Digisol ever...
8 bad
9 too low connectivity when you see it has 3 antenna
10 disappointed, it just stopped working after 15days. total waste of money on the router and making connection
11 connection isses
12 after 10 it was not worked correctly
13 this router is having problem. loosing connection in every few houres. digisol HR3400 is better option. infact it is best option in terms of range(coverage).
14 DIVISOR 3400 AND DIGISOL1400 IS BETTER.
15 good
16 Good product at affordable price. Good service by Flipkart with timely delivery and excellent packaging.

25 Ranger good ..Ossam speed No problem
26 Work good and easy to install
27 I PURCHASED THIS ROUTER FOR WHOPPING 2000/- FROM FLIPKART. AND SEE THE COST OF IT NOW. The range is good. I already have the old digisol router. And i was so happy with my old router that i thought i will buy the same brand for better range. I only got few meters range extra and guess what .............to transfer files between laptop and desktop it has reduced 20 times ....from 4-5 mbps to 500kpbs .........pathetic..........i was banging my head on the wall.....because i have all the movie f...

105 It not work as we expected from triple antenna and it is also not work like double antenna, continuously dropping connection that's why i want to restart wifi continuously. it is set in my hall and when i go in bedroom it does not give me range hardly give 1signal. installation is also bad experience their site www.digisol.com is not working i don't know why flipkart sell duplicate or bogus information and sale that bad or defective product.
106 Received product in right time and in proper  condition. Keep it up. Thanks
107 After 10 days of usage ... I mast say the worst product I ever got form Flipkart .. I ordered this product on 26th December usually I have no issues with the delivery what so ever but the surprising thing I got is the box was broken both of the side , no Ethernet cable included one antina was broken but fortunately product I got was in working condition I don't know who maid this mistake but seriously telling this is not done I mean how could Flipkart did
108 Will this work with Airtel broad band? If yes I will giv it a 5 star ! And buy it
109 Cable missing and seal broken
110 Is this ADSL router ? Can run with BSNL broadband ?

Digisol DG-BG4300NU/IS Router :
0 I thought the two antena is powerful but no.....its just looks like stick...good but not very good.....range is little bad if any obstracles around...(like wall)it is beautiful....it is very good for open area and small office.....It is modem+router.....
1 Iam from GOA and using this router for about 1 year. This is one of the best router.You can use it with 3g dongles as well as bsnl or other adsl isp.It gives lifetime warranty (i.e 5 yrs). Go for this product one of the best product by digisol
2 It is a ADSL2/2+ modem + routerIt has USB ports which supports multiple USB based datacards and Hard drives.However it does not support US printers as it does not have a print server functionality.I have not used this modem but writing this so that others do not ignore it thinking its just a plain wifi router.Probably the only good Indian product - in the crowd of Chinese/Taiwanese products.
3 Not the best tho
4 Working fine since purchased.wi-fi signal strength is good.good product for purchase.flipkart delivery is also good.
5 I bought this product reading multiple reviews on Flipkart. The product is good in a way that it is Modem + Router and has option to put a 3G dongle also.Note that 4G dongle does not fit in the slot (I am using Airtel 4G dongle).The settings have lot of advanced options including to read USB drive fitted in the USB slot provided in the router (did not try for external hard drive yet)The only reason of 3 stars is because of its range. I expected a much better range, but the product does ...
6 Quality is good. Working well so far. Good range for a 2 BHK. Other routers were not working for my society's particular internet service provider. So they asked me to buy digisol, and it is working fine now.

Digisol DG-BA3321 Data Card :
0 Hi Everyone, I bought this USB Modem for my laptop 1 month before . I have used USB modem(s) previously in which i faced problems like Automatic disconnection due to shaking, Network Unavailability and so on. Before i saw this USB modem, i already have Digisol 4313 Nu Router which i bought two years back that's works like a charm. So buying Digisol never made me confused.Now coming to this product. It serves GSM, EDGE, GPRS, UMTS, HSUPA, HSDPA, UMTS Network types. The sim slot is very conv...
1 Great product.Pros1. LED indications2. Cost3. Call facilityCons1. Data usage details cannot be viewed directly.Verdict:  Go for it.
2 The device is quite poorly designed. SIM slot is a front loading tray which will be problem for those who need to use micro using adapter, not to mention that the tray will break sooner than those which don't have a tray.The company's website doesn't provide any resolutions or customer care which is again a big problem.
3 this adapter is best.. and worth it too.. so bindass buy.!! i am using digisol adapter from last three years, old one have no calling features.. but i ordered this adapter last month n it have calling and sms features too.. so if u wanna buy an adapter any time u can go for digisol.. flipkart service is also good... as always... :)happy with the product and flipkart too.!!
4 flipkart services are best in India . but this item is  just okey, the plastic quality is  bad. Also pulling out the socket for the sim card is not really smooth, and therefore gives a fear that it may break anytime. SIM slot is a front loading tray which will be problem for those who need to use micro using adapter, not to mention that the tray will break sooner than those which don't have a tray.The company's website doesn't provide any resolutions or customer care which is also a big pr...
5 Used this device for few hours. Found it just okey. Although the plastic quality is really bad. Also pulling out the socket for the sim card is not really smooth, and therefore gives a fear that it may break anytime. Soft WiFi requires a third part utility and is not the inbuilt feature of the utility that comes with this dongle - although this feature has not worked for me so far, need to investigate more. Overall, this is a good cheap device.
6 Great within a low price range
7 worth of money
8 very good product .
9 It's best for 3g usage but it will work for 5 to 6 hours without stopping best dongle
10 poor quality
11 Good
12 Nice
13 Satisfied
14 Best product
15 V3RY awesome product.Mi d blowingIts cost is less than market price.I am using modem singh 2 yers.But there no single issue about it.Its cost umer care service is also better 5han other.Very good product I recommend to buy it.
16 Good
17 It is very nice and fast
18 Good product
19 Nice one & good service
20 Great Product.. compatible with every GSM 3G sim..user friendly
21 Just Awesome
22 Good product....with reasonable price....thanks to flipkart
23 i tried it in windows sp2, 7 and also in 8, it takes about half an hour to get connected and also requires restarting the pc.finally i thrown it away. so buy at your own risk.
24 Digisol DG-BA3321 HSPA 21.6 Mbps 3.75G Broadband Modem Adapter best for wireless data use an this is a nice product & brand also
25 * very good product at this price point * No issues with continuous usage* No Card reader Slot but can be acceptable at this price point
26 I am using this product since 1 week, This is excellent product and extraordinary fast internet connecting and downloading in low price. Filpkart offering this product with very low priced. All sims are working automatically. If any first time searching for Data Card, blindly go to but this one for good experience.
27 this data card works well for bsnl 3g, no dis connect,    ussd, voice calling available. good product in cheap price.
28 flipkart services are best in India. got the product in two days .....regarding the product its a decent product
29 im using this since one month. very nice and excellant product. initially i faced some problem in connecting to the internet and i thought the product might be faulty but when i inserted Airtel sim i got excellant network and a faster internet. thanks to flipkart speedy delivery.
30 Digisol DG-BA3321  modem I purchased for its economical price but I was amazed by its Performance. I have downloaded and watched several movies and books at a very faster rate with 3G connections of Vodafone and BSNL both available with me giving a very satisfactory result.I recommend the product as a high rated purchase as a superfast modem.
31 I bought it 2 days back ,Easy to connectComes with soft-wifi though not included in the featuresNo heating and No disconnecting. When i compared it with other Data Cards the internet accessibility is faster as i expected and better who are willing to buy this product can blindly go for it.
32 You have disapointment my trust on you because of your return facility This modem always close when I connect internet
33 so far it is good.i can recommend it for friend. Attractive price.3g speed is good  ,flipkart delivery is very fast,customer friendly,thanks to flipkart
34 Performance is too bad,unable to provide a reliable data connection.Compared to my mobile phone its connection is very very  unstable.Better not to buy.Build quality is OK.Sometimes very difficult to establish a network connection.Connection is not spontaneous.It breaks frequently.its not useful. Dont buy Save your money..........................................................................................................................................

Digisol Wireless 150N USB Adapter :
0 Ordered this Device 1 Week Earlier this is an Excellent Device Signal Strength is Excellent Signal Doesnt Drop  Easy Interface Connects Automatically Each time Digisol isn’t the name that strikes you when you think of network components, but it’s gaining traction slowly. The Digisol Wireless 150N USB adapter is the most compact and easy to use of the lot and works well on older OS’es as well. Feature set is pretty much the same as the other two on this list, save for the fact that it has li...
1 Awesome product from Digisol. with lifetime (5 years) of warranty is more than enough, and price is lowest as compared to others.can be used for web browsing/internet.Excellent range 20 to 25 meter..
2 I had ordered 3 Digisol 150N wifi adapters, but what I got is a set of 3 wifi adapters of some unknown company. Additionally they have sent aUSB mouse to compensate for the low price wifi adapters.
3 First and foremost thanks to flipkart for delivering the product in quick time. order placed on 09-mar-2013 and it was delivered on 13-mar-2013, 5 days in advance of the expected date mentioned.Secondly i have started using digisol wifi adapter, it is very easy it install from the CD since i am using Microsoft XP all i had to do is run the set up thats it. the installation was completed in just a minute or so no steps involved. after that all i had to do is enter the secuirty key and start u...
4 I was very pleased with this Product , it was easy to install and use , once connected to wifi setup it automatically connects every time , but i was disappointed with flipkart , who took hell lot of time to deliver the product to me , i had to raise the issue only then product was dispatched , but never got any explanation for the delay from the Flipkart , but received a call from customer care after i received the product .
5 Does not get detected on my Win7 64bit PC.Tried downloading the latest drivers from the website also.I have a Dlink WiFi Router.
6 flipkart delivered it with a good sealed package.thanks to flipkart guys.Its working fine in Windows XP & Windows 7 (I personally checked )Driver disc included in the package so hassle free.light weighted, very easy to use anywhere with any pc. so no issues.over all: fantabulous. 5 stars to this wonder piece.thank you guys.
7 I am using this device with my digisol wifi router and it works so fine till now, no interuptions and nothing.And about the product, it comes with a driver CD but i already has it downloaded so it is of no use for me. Then you dont have to be a computer maniac to do the initial installation and setup, even a normal computer can do that and the digisol utility makes it so simple for you.Regarding the connectivity, just plug-in the device thats all it connects automatically to the default...
8 I ordered this on 17th Oct at 10am and flipkart delivered it to me on 18th at 3-30pm well before timne as is their practice!I immediately pushed it into the USB 2.0 port, installed the driver software and gosh! I get a wi fi connection at 120mbps! With the onboard wifi on my L:enovo laptop I was getting only 54 mbps! I had to go for this because the built in wi fi was failing  by dropping and reconnecting frequently.So now i ahve two wi fi network connections! I disabled the onboard one and n...
9 The device is pretty good and is very useful too. However, it frequently disconnects and only a sequence of "uninstalling the driver" and "reinstalling" fixes the problem for sometime. I checked the internet and this is a known problem. Digisol is a marketing company basically - they driver is provided by RealTek. So downloaded an updated driver from RealTek website and uninstalled DigiSol's drivers and utilities. RealTek drivers are worth.Digisol would have to address this concern immedia...
10 good
11 good
12 It's ok
13 Been using it for years. Works great, the fact that it has lasted this long is beyond my expectations.
14 Gud product
15 Good but not upto the mark.
16 Plz don't buy this product from seller :- AccessIT  because this guy is cheating people and giving a cheap local product and he does not have option for cancellation too, he just says there will be replacement guarantee for 10days only...

32 Easy installation ...Good receiving wifi signals good range..Flipkart fast delivery also good Had a great experience buying on Flipkart
33 The product is goodYou can buy it its signal catching power is good
34 Are you thinking to use wifi in your desktop ?without not hesitation go ahead with this product. Believe me you won't regret.  It provides a good connectivity. I got 75MByte per second network speed with it's full fledged operation, I think it is more than enough for any Internet Users.
35 I am unable to connect this product .i feel buying this product is killing our time.it never get automatically connected even. after re-istalation
36 Super Fast & Fantastic response to the speedy WiFi Router which sends out 300MBPS - though this adapter is 150MBPS - it enabled saving a movie through the net 1.44 GB Movie downloaded in under two minutes
37 As the name indicates ....It has some reputation over Network Devices !!Good Range , nice GUI for operating the stuff ... what else u want !!can share and receive wifi signals over wide range of frequency , Comprises of Mac-ID restrictions so u can share Files/Internet to the one U knw (*.^)
38 Worked well with my windows xp pc with any glitch. was a little confused about how to run it without having to connect it manually each time i logged on the pc but even that was sorted. digisol does have a decent service response. had to wait patiently but the response was good.
39 Have Used this for the past 18 months, found no Major issues . Working like a Charm.Go for it..
40 Please do not buy if you are running any Ubuntu, Red hat operating system. However, it works like charm with windows 7, no need to use CD comes with it. Don't relay with the small disc comes along with it, download driver from internet. Unfortunately driver available for wondows only.
41 Really a good piece of item in this price. Nicely running for few months with a consistent performance. Easy plug n play, trendy - nice one to bring your device within wireless.
42 works smooth n jus fyn .... but nly problem is drivers are not available on net ....you hav to use installation cd ..
43 serves the purpose for what it is meant for. no connection drop observed, running smooth till date. price of this product is ok.
44 Hi, Was looking for options to get rid of these wiring & LAN cables & found this product.I have my PC in one room & wireless modem in another & was having issues regarding LAN cable wiring. But with this wireless adapter, I just plugged it to usb port of my pc, installed the software from Cd, & now enjoying wireless network at good speed without any issues.Would definitely recommend this product. Also thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery !!
45 Excellent Product.   Bought it from Flipkart.Good Product.   This takes care of all the needs,    Basic User  or Demanding User.Its an absolute delight.Drivers provided along with the product are required to install in all versions of Microsoft Windows.
46 Bought this for my secondary desktop. The product was delivered on time and was well packaged. Took only a few minutes to install and setup. Beeing working fine ever since.
47 I  used this adapter with D-link wifi router. it worked for one month then speed dropped and started heating . rj45 is a better choice than this product.
48 NO WORDS TO SAY...BECAUSEITS AMAZING DEVICE TO USE WITH  DESKTOP.NO HEATING,SPEED IS TOO GOOD WITHIN RANGE
49 Works fine i am using it in my laptop for the past 3 months i din't face a single problem,i am extreme user of my wifi connection though it stands still..talking about the range i am using it for ground floor and 1st floor, the signal is two points in 1st floor not bad (cons) not that much wifi range 30-40mt can use it for home purpose  that's my review thanks for reading
50 This is so tiny and fits in the USB port of laptops. Can turn your Desktop to a wifi receiver in just few steps of installation to get rid of all the lan cables. Works with Both Linux and Windows too. Additional driver softwares might be needed for specific linux distributions.
51 just like plug and play. works with xp,vista,7 and 8. just install the cd which is provided and then restart the pc .when restarting you have to plug hardware device(digisol) in to the pc port.after that you chose your mode and enjoy.                thank's flipkart
52 its range is good. we can use it as wifi hub. i mean we can share computer internet to other devices like phones laptops. we can connect network through wifi also.
53 A good product from reputed company. very small in size, Price is little bit costlier. Should have cheaper by Rs 150-250
54 this device gets heated up soon. and it is also costly than other local products which has been functioning equal to this. reduction in price will increase its demand
55 Good product. Performance so far is good. Its small profile is an added advantage compared to big and bulky ones.
56 Well i saw the  MRP of this product around 1100/- in some computer shop  , but I insisted the person to sell me in flipkart rate , hence I saved .My laptop  suddenly stopped detecting WIFI . Drivers were all fine . So i got this adapter finally .It  just took some 4-5 min to install with the CD provided .Best part is , this product is so conspicuous , that u will forget u have a adapter plugged to your laptop! . And yes it comes with a life time warranty !!!I did not encountered with an...
57 Digisol Wireless 150N USB Adapter has a very easy setup and no stress at all... but for Bigger screen sizes i would prefer it elder brother the 300N ...
58 Non intrusive because of small size. Had to work a but, but made it work on my very old linux PC. It's wireless now!Stable drivers, no issues whatsoever once I got past the initial pains of installing on linux.
59 Works very stable, and hasn't given any problems till date. Used it continuously for 3 months. No hassle installation on a windows machine. Speed are also constant.
60 I bought this product from flipkart in may and ever since been happy with the product. i like the range the devise gives, good speed and its tiny enough to go unnoticed. also doesnt get very heated up.
61 I am using it more than a month and hangup in the middle and you have plug out and in, the device and you loose your internet connection in the middle of work and you will be frustrated.Not good
62 A great product. Pros:Simple to installRe-attaches itself to the preferred network upon restart of computerSmall sizeFits tightly on the laptop, so it can remain there permanentlyCons:Software hangs once in a while, doesn't minimize to tray and remains on the screen ... but not a big deal
63 good product .. working fine with my computer , the only thing I feel bad is It is not plug and play, I can't use it in every computer , I have to install the driver first. I have seen in software one option radio on/off , I don't try what it is, we can disable adaptor from software itself if we are not using, Inside one blue led is there....thats all friends...
64 A good product, very useful for any type of Desktop or Laptop which is not having WiFi card. easy to use and install its driver to the system (one time installation) and very small size and will fit well to any usb port, and gives very good speed too. just keep this device plugged-in to your system and just enjoy and connect to any network with WiFi..!!!.And about Flipkart --- very nice deal and prompt service and delivery. I got this item in two days of my order.. very good.!
65 as usual the packaging along with the delivery time too good . . . . product too is performing well . . . . signal strength is excellent, no signal break ups or disconnection . . . . you can consider buying. kudos to flipkart. keep it up.
66 I bought this in Richie Street, Chennai.Though I never heard the name of this company, the shop keeper suggested me this and I bought it as I had no other option. But out of my doubt, the performance was good and its still better. I would suggest anyone to go for this if they want a WiFi USB Adapter between the low and high price range.
67 As my review title suggests, this dongle is very tiny... just like a chewing gum :PPerformance : If you just intend to use it for surfing internet over wifi , then you would never face any issue ... It works perfectly !! But if you want to use it for streaming/home networking...  i read on here only that there is some problem with linux.. cant say anything on that !Final Suggestion : Go for this....................
68 No another brand will give you the nano adapter on that price. it is a worth buying Digisol USB adapter, i using it from past 15 days and didnt face any problem with this. in fact it is working very fine. thanks to flipkart as well for delivering the product with in 2 days time.
69 This wireless usb adapter renders excellent connectivity with my wireless router My router is placed in the living room, i am using this adapter in the bedroom which is almost around 30 Feet distance.Still then i am getting good signal strength and optimal performance. one more extra feature is its size, its very very small, but a powerful one Go ahead and buy this product,do not worry about the performance its amazing.Also i would like to thank flipkart for delivering this at an affordable...
70 Good
71 I love to buy from Flipkart but It costs 100/- more than the price at other sites. So, I will go there because there is no difference in the product either on Flipkart or other sites.
