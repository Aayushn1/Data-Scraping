Anantha Krishnan,Nov  2017,Flipkart,The router is fine. It is so compact. Small sized. Less weight. No heating problems. Connecting to the net is fast. Range is good. It would be better if you keep the router in the middle part of your house. Speed is the same. I saw a comment earlier that this router boosted the speed. But the speed remains the same.Anyway it is a good router under 1000rs. If you are looking for a budget router go for it.,Digisol DG-HR3400 Router,No,No

Dimpi Kulkarni,Nov  2014,Flipkart,Hi Everyone  I bought this USB Modem for my laptop 1 month before . I have used USB modem(s) previously in which i faced problems like Automatic disconnection due to shaking  Network Unavailability and so on. Before i saw this USB modem  i already have Digisol 4313 Nu Router which i bought two years back that's works like a charm. So buying Digisol never made me confused.Now coming to this product. It serves GSM  EDGE  GPRS  UMTS  HSUPA  HSDPA  UMTS Network types. The sim slot is very conv...,Digisol DG-BA3321 Data Card,No,No

Avnish Mishra,Jan  2015,Flipkart,The device is quite poorly designed.

BAPPA  JHA,Jun  2015,Flipkart,flipkart services are best in India . but this item is  just okey  the plastic quality is  bad.

Vivek Kumar,Mar  2015,Flipkart,Used this device for few hours. Found it just okey. Although the plastic quality is really bad. Also pulling out the socket for the sim card is not really smooth  and therefore gives a fear that it may break anytime. Soft WiFi requires a third part utility and is not the inbuilt feature of the utility that comes with this dongle - although this feature has not worked for me so far  need to investigate more.
