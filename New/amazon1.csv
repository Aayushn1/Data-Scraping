Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband:
sandeep tivari,26 June 2017,Amazon,The first week of buying the router  it was working fine.Then the problems started.Everyday at least thrice a day it disconnects by itself without any explanation.Only when restarting the router does it connect to the internet.It's infuriating.People  please don't buy this product as you'll be cheated.I don't want people to be screwed the same way I am.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Jagadish Achuthanna,11 September 2016,Amazon,First of all i got it for 899/- and delivered two days before delivery date.... if u see the picture of router in amazon it looks very big.. but actual size is too small.. working fine no heating problem...I m writing this after 15 days of my usage it is working awesomely no problem i can get signals to my every corner of my room it can be wall mounted... my strong recommendation u can purchase without any hesitation,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Jagadish Achuthanna,20 September 2017,Amazon,Guys I am using this router for more than a year  it comes with life time warranty. Till then no single problem had arrived with this product. It gives good connection speed on wifi. Its perfect for small and medium home/area.PROS:#double antenna#great range ( depends upon how much walls the signal has to travel to reach from router to the device)#supports both 2.5ghz and 5ghz frequency#easy setup#portable#4 lan ports#life time warranty#good service#value for moneyCONS:#As such no cons for this product.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
sandeep tivari,1 May 2017,Amazon,MADE IN INDIA ;)It is better than Belkin for the price range.The range is good and had no problems yet. Using it since eight months.Check for service centers nearby just in case.Received it in four days. Packaging was good.Tip: Check with your broadband before buying a router as the requirement may differ.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
TNT Fusion,9 June 2017,Amazon,Writing this review after one year of use .This product is made in India and it is best to use the Indian product   I have been using this router for more than one year and its working like beast.* Have been using 24*7 for 365 days have never powered down.Coverage area is good it covers my whole bungalow completely as well as gives me coverage on 2nd floor as well i have installed it on 1st floor so it covers the area well.Would like to give 5 + rating for the product   guys go for it the price offered is best with two antenna router   previously used products like D-Link and i-ball router but this is best in class.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
T3M,23 June 2017,Amazon,Overall performance is good....,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Yogesh soman,17 February 2018,Amazon,You wouldn't find any defect till one month of use. Coverage is quite good. Sometimes I get signal at a distance of 25 meters with multiple walls blocking.But After one month use film started  the wifi router started disconnecting  automatically after every 2-3 hours of use. You have to restart it to resolve the problem. Additionally  this problem is  well discussed in sevaral reviews here  but Amazon still supplying faulty product to its customers.Interestingly if you try to do some R&D to resolve the disconnection problem yourselves  here Digidol doesn't provide updated firmware software anywhere over Internet  so you just stuck with faulty product. No customer service number working either.Howcome Amazon can claim that this product has lifelong warranty?,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Manigandan Smartdesigner,15 July 2017,Amazon,Well after a month of usage... This has got to be a crap Router. Stay away from buying anythign cheap. A Dlink or TP Link would anytime do a better job. My neighbours got the same connection (ISP) as I do but mine keeps dropping out. Its range is terrible. I would advise buyers to not look at a mere 200-300 price difference. Consider this... You are placing a sell on stocks and the connection keeps popping out and there you go your intraday loss is over 1000 as you missed the bus. Thats wht happened with me.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
P Sharma,1 March 2019,Amazon,Great product at the price point we get it but only problem with it is weak in wireless repeater mode also I have two Digisol Routers out of which one had dead but can't do anything as there is no service centre being in Surat  Gujarat means you can't expect service if it is having any problems but it use to work well most of the times other router had already completed warranty period of 5 years still working great,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
sandeep tivari,31 July 2016,Amazon,From 4 days I am using it......and seems to be a good product....range is good and it can cover 1200 sq feet area....,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Jagadish Achuthanna,29 June 2018,Amazon,Product- 5/5Amazon Delivery- 3/5 ( Not that great this time)Box packaging- 4/5 (Not so premium)In box- Product with fixed tilted antenas(2)  Product guide booklet  driver cd( I didn't find that useful)  power cable 5V 1Amp (enough long and adapter is good quality)  a short lan cablesetup- Takes around 1 min ( if you have experince  just connect and go to default router gateway with default id/pw then setup with isp static ip)Connection- I use 2 Lan ports and 2 mobile phones over wifi still no significant speed capping visible.Range- (The best Thing) I have 3 rooms on ground floor and 1 room on 1st floor  all the rooms get equal 4 bars and lawn area get 3 bars of signal over wifi  even my neighbours get 1-2 bars even they are 50-70 mts away. In a nutshell I didn't expect that.I use Alliance fibre optic broadband on ROB circle and use 8-10 mbps pack and get the exact speed on wifi and LANCompany provides 3 yrs of warrenty on main router and 1 yr of warrenty on power adapter that's good.Con- 1.Build quality not so good.  2. Fixed antenna.Verdict- Best for small home  full paisa vasool  Strongly recommendedP.S- I got it on amazon on Rs. 943 ( effectively 848 bcoz the upi transaction 10% cashback) that is a steal deal for me  because I search that exact same model on few offline stores they demand 1250-1300.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Pratik,29 August 2016,Amazon,This product looks very small but the impact it creates is very high. Honestly I did not expect this high performance from Digisol.I saved money by buying this low cost product and very happy with its performance.Signal never drops below 40Mbps.For me whose max speed before this was 8Mbps this is true rock stor signal performance.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Pramit S,7 December 2017,Amazon,I bought this router in Feb 2016. It gave some trouble during the initial installation. The customer support was technically knowledgeable  but expected me to sit around the router all day troubleshooting it with their assistance. After eventual successful installation  it worked reasonably well. The range is not particularly good. Does not work well through walls. It has now begun to fail  needs to be rebooted every hour or so. I'm on the market for a new router now.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Sridhar Sivaraman,8 January 2017,Amazon,connection keeps dropping and when i look on the networks available my wifi is available but when i click connect its asking for password again   i type the password and it says wrong password !what i had to do was to reboot the router   then it connects fine   but this keeps happening about 3 times a day so not great,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Navin Kashyap,8 July 2017,Amazon,Pretty awesome in every which way. I get a signal even 3 floors below. Have never switched it off in 2 years!! No heating issues. Can be easily configured as a bridge or a repeater. I really like the Active client table and ability to set up temporary guest network.It unfortunately doesnt support ddwrt or openwrt. Sometimes some of my devices fail to connect even though they detect it  a quick reboot solves this.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Amazon Customer,25 January 2019,Amazon,This is the best router which covers wide area(signals) in this price range  i have used many routers like tp link   tenda   d link  but no other router gives signals like this one.. i covers my whole Home    and i even get its signal in the park front of my home.my home is around (1782.72 .sq .ft)  . and the the is double of it.. also i want to mention that i am using this router from almost around 3 years   nd i have placed my router at the center of my house  nd i am able to use my wifi behind 4 walls  easily.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Abhishek Ramesh,8 September 2016,Amazon,Its good for the price paid. range is decent   easy to configure and setup. Has a lot of features  and its definitely better than other chinese routers you can buy.Digisol needs some polishing up with their features like QOS and IP blocking  URL blocking ext though . i have to reconfigure the qos like everyday.overall i'd recommend this router,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Baldeep singh,10 April 2018,Amazon,crap product. Restarting every 5 seconds. Many people are facing same problem. Replaced product twice  all have same issue. No use of replacement at service center. Don't buy this.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband,No,No

Digisol-wireless-micro-adapter-DG-WN3150Nu:
Rick,18 June 2018,Amazon,Pros:-1. Similar price to tp-link wifi adapter.2. It's made by an Indian networking manufacturing company "DIGISOL"  which will last longer than any Chinese counter part.3. Built quality is strong.4. Supports in Windows XP  Viata  7  8  8.1 and 10. (I have tested in all the OS)5. Don't forget to install the wireless wlan driver from the provided CD.6. Using it for last 3 years   it's still working fine and this is my second device.Cons:-1. Range of reception quality is not strong enough more than 10 metres.2. Not sure that it supports MacOS or Linux.3. Maximum bandwidth speed shows 72.2Mbps not 150Mbps (I don't know why).Overall It's a Indian product buy it blindly without any hesitation.Hit the "helpful" button at the end.Thank You!!,Digisol-wireless-micro-adapter-DG-WN3150Nu,No,No

Manish Sharma,21 February 2019,Amazon,This router is good for usage on mobile and tablets even on laptops for emails and browsing. Also good for streaming content through firetv. But fails miserably when using business application like Skype for business. If you are on call with screenshare then god saves u. This router has less ram and not enough processor power so once network load increase throughout flactuates between 100mbps to 160 but never reach 300. Had to reboot several times. Got it replaced once but no luck my Tplink 841N is always better. Dont buy this router HR3400 instead buy Tplink 841 which has broadcom chip and stable reliable further is cheaper than this model.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Amazon Customer,15 August 2016,Amazon,It's an amazing product. I had my own doubts before I purchased this but so many positive reviews here on Amazon have compelled me to go for it. Was using a Belkin router 150 MBPS but honestly I never experienced the speed and the range that I experienced on this. My ISP is Act Corp Internet(Beam Tele) at 40 MBPS speed. I was completely dumbstruck at the speed I was getting on Digisol. All the apps on my mobile and the tablet are opening in fractions of seconds which is at least 4-5 times faster than my old router. Coming to the range none of the phones in the last few years have caught the wifi signal in my bedroom where the signals from the router has to pass through two heavy walls. I always had to come out of the room or switch on to 3G/4G to browse in my room. But after installing this router I'm getting the wifi signals in those spots of the room where I never got any in all these years and that too with amazing speeds. In fact I was really surprised if this is what the speed is. This router is a perfect justice for the 40 MBPS Interet unlike my old one. Thanks for all the positive reviews on Amazon that helped me making my decision.,Digisol-DG-HR3400-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender:
Keshav chandran,2 October 2017,Amazon,This is my second device after the same one lasted for the past 3.5 yrs and finally went kaput one fine day. I wanted to upgrade and bofuht a tp link dual band extender . Unfortunately it wasn't able to pick signal. So I ordered this again. Though it's not fancy and has a single band 2.4 ghz and claims to have upto 300mbps speeds  the most important feature is it's signal strength. It's able to pick signal from my router in the ground floor without line of sight and transmit it on the first floor where this is installed . This is the main reason for going for this model. Configuring was easy enough with wps on both ends.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
Sridhar Sivaraman,26 September 2017,Amazon,I used it and I got a cd with it but no setup file.Thats the basic thing but got missed.I already have a digisol wifi router and I bought this to avoid any compatibility issues. But when I googled the setup all the videos have 2 different routers. In my case I have both as digisol. SO very confusing for me to setup this extender via LAN of my original digisol router.Need desperate help on step by step to setup this extender to my primary digisol wifi router via LAN cable.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
Keshav chandran,26 April 2015,Amazon,Very good product. I purchased it from amazon after returning back the earlier brought tp link extender. TP Link extender did not worked even after repeated efforts. This works well  even though i did not had WNS option  it was quiet easy to set up  about 5 min or so. It works well with the main router and serves the purpose. Also the video streaming and surfing is at a very good speed  there is no drop in the speed. Very rarely there is a issue where in device gets stuck while conecting to this wifi signal with the error "Obtaining IP address". But this gets resolved after turning off the main modem and this modem and restarting both. I have removed one star for this but still its much better than other products in competetion. Overall i would recommend this product to others.RegardsSamarth,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
Sridhar Sivaraman,28 January 2015,Amazon,I have a D- Link wifi modem. This is the only repeater that gets connected and provides good networking.I've tried TP-Link as well D-Link repeaters and none of them gets connected easily. Infact i was unable to get any internet connection thru TP-Link range extenders and the D-Link repeater has a very poor interface and security.The main problem is the life of the product. i've lost 4 repeaters to malfunctioning over 2.5 years. And I'm currently waiting for a replacement from the company.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
Samarth,3 October 2016,Amazon,i got a Digisol Wireless Repeater through Amazon. It was installed yesterday by a technician from Actnet  who did the job injust 10 minutes. I am now able to receive good internet connectivity in my hall as well as upstairs  when I keep one windowopen. The product is simply magnificent. Earlier  I was not getting connectiity in the hall  due to signals being weak. But withthe Digisol Repeater  I am able to work with comfort and ease  and the connectiity and strength of signals is also excellent.A very good product  at a very cheap price. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to everyone in a home  as their WIFI routers/modemswill have a very limited range  and the Digisol repeater enables connectity to a greater area  exactly as advertised.Further  in reply to a communication to Help desk of Digisol  made yesterday night  I got a nice informative   helpful reply from Digisol.This clearly shows that this is one product you can go in for  without any second thought. I am happy I have bought this,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
sameer kaushal,19 February 2016,Amazon,Not very happy.have problem in connecting  without repeater I used to connect with 4-5 gadgets simultaneously(I am using Digisol modem with router ) but once I connected with the repeater I find it difficult even to connect with one gadget some times and I am forced to switch off the repeater at times.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No

Sridhar Sivaraman,15 July 2015,Amazon,I don't know why amazon  which is the number one in online sales and most trusted site  encourages such useless products. The repeater is such a useless product. First of all is is very difficult to connect the device  just to find that the range is just increased to a mere few yards. Just waste of money. It is working  hence couldn't be returned.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No

Nicola C.,25 May 2015,Amazon,I bought this item because my router was in the bedroom and the signal was somewhat weak in other rooms after passing through many walls. It was easy enough to set up as per the supplied instructions  and does what it's supposed to do  ie  boost the wifi signal. The only issue I have is that my phone prefers to stick with the less powerful router signal unless I manually turn off and on the wifi radio on the phone. Same goes for my Teewe device.  I feel it's a bit overpriced since routers are available for half the price but this is the cheapest repeater I could find  and there aren't too many in the market. I bought it for Rs.1359.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
Amazon Customer,5 December 2015,Amazon,I bought this to replace the earlier Digisol Repeater taken about two years ago  which suddenly went 'kaput' one  fine morning.I could not locate the bill and warranty card of earlier one  so could not claim its free replacement  as it comes with life time warranty. So had to buy this new one.All is okay with this but find that On-Off switch is just not there in the new design  which is not good and you have to remove the plugged device altogether to re-start or shut it down.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No
C Samuel,26 April 2015,Amazon,The installation was a bit problem esp Mac security. Now its working well range is good. At times u have to reconfigure it.WAPS configurations failed once for me.otherwise good for the price.,Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender,No,No

Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router:
Ravi Prakash Pandey,21 July 2018,Amazon,I have used several ADSL routers over past 12 years but this one from digisol is best of them. My location is about 3 kms from the BSNL exchange and earlier connection dropouts were common especially in summers and rainy season. But after installing this router that problem is now almost gone. In addition to that this router offers far more functionality than what BSNL issued modems provide.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Amazon Customer,26 November 2018,Amazon,The white color was not available as shown in photo but the seller immediately called me as soon as I ordered this to ask if it's okay to send black color instead.The packaging and all was very neat and good.Now let's come to main pointThe durability - the modem is very durable and small so m happy with itRange - the range of this wi fi is similar to any other modem at this range but what makes it different is it's strength signal. It's full even from 3 room next to it.Made in India - that's what I liked the most. If something is made in India n worthy of it I always buy itObviously there are cons too for example the reset button I doubt it u can press it with hand n side power button looks like made of some cheap plastic quality but I definitely suggest this to anyone looking for modem n router at this price range cuz no problems on my end 👍,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Ravi Prakash Pandey,7 November 2017,Amazon,One of the best modems that I ever Purchased. Before purchasing this I had DLink Asus but didnt get this type of performance. Very easy to Install. Now Iam having fast Internet connection and using BSNL bradbandThanks to Digisol IndiaProud to say thatIts an Indian product,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Kavita Negi,2 November 2018,Amazon,A compact & sturdy ADSL2+ modem & router.Based on the newer N series with 300 Mbps network speed.Suports 3G dongles too.Carries 3 year warranty.Been using it with  my bsnl connection via landline.Has two 5db gain antennas for better & strong connection.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Parshwanth Hegde,21 September 2018,Amazon,Configuring it took some time. The logo on the product still looks suspicious about the originality of the item. Though it is working fine.Even the web portal look different when connected through 192.168.1.1,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Neeraj Vishwakarma,24 March 2018,Amazon,So Far So Good with BSNL ADSL BB connection which is 10mbps speed. It has been week this modem has been setup. And the coverage of WiFi is pretty good also there is no connection drop issue. The modem interface is designed with web based UI and we have more options compared with other modem. Pretty good  modem made in INDIA.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Sravan (Madhu),2 January 2019,Amazon,I bought this on june 2018 and writing it on jan 2019. I think it is a good product for me. I bought this for ₹1350/-. No any issue felt but I didn't felt any serious advantage of having the second antenna  ie; I can't feel any serious boost of the wifi network in my house with the two antenna while comparing with my previous one antenna modem. Maybe it is due to wifi traveling issue in my house (have lots of walls). But like i said i didn't feel any loss of speed even though the signal strength are low. Also our devices must be capable to grab the signal very well,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
ganesh,8 July 2018,Amazon,First time ever I am really dissatisfied with the packaging of Amazon India. The box as shown in the picture is damaged. This box was just inside a Plastic Packet and no separate carton box was given by the seller in this case to protect the original device box. Amazon insists on providing original covers tags etc while accepting a return but they should look into this lackadaisical approach of packaging by the seller.Coming to the device  it works justs brilliantly with my BSNL ADSL Line. Setting it up was a breeze and it provides good speed and coverage with its two antennas. I am receiving pretty decent coverage on my first floor room as well as through out the house with the device placed at a corner room in my house.The box consists of Router device  Power adapter  a splitter for adsl line and telephone  Short RJ45 cable  two telephone cables for connecting the device.It also has a quick start guide  a installer cd with step by step instructions on how to install the device properly.Just go for it you will not repent buying this device.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Swali,7 August 2018,Amazon,The router is easy to set up and manage. Has three options for internet connection - ADSL  RJ45 and USB dongle support. I am using it with USB dongle at the moment and it is good for the purpose.But it does have one issue. It frequently redirects to Tata Docomo wired broadband site. At first I thought the issue is with my computer but no it happens on all my devices  all the phones and even my friends' laptops when browsing through this router. It is very annoying at times.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Amazon Customer,18 November 2016,Amazon,I was initially disappointed with this as it seemed to be designed for internet input through telephone line (RJ11) whereas my internet connection was through RJ45 (regular lan cable). Later I read the manual which indicated that we could connect internet to the router by inserting RJ45 cable from modem into LAN1 port of router. This did not work initially. So I called the tech support and the lady there guided me systematically through all the settings and lo... it started working like a charm. Signal strength is also very good. I've got a duplex house with router on lower floor but get good signal in upper floor also. Kudos to this made in India product.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No
Rohan singh,20 November 2016,Amazon,Surprisingly packing was not upto the mark. Is amazon saving on bubble wrap?

Amazon Customer,19 March 2017,Amazon,Modem-cum-router doing its job fine but a little bit disappointed as the web interface doesnt provide the USB HDD support. Although here on amazon in the product description its mentioned that it supports USB dongle and Mass storage. But in real its a deception. It doesnt support mass storage. The Digisol customer support ate up all my time in setting this up  else i would have returned it and checked for some other router. Be aware!,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Jaykishore,24 July 2017,Amazon,The product is good and I am using USB 4G dongle to it that works well. I have tested with BSNL and IDEA connection and I have seen getting above 10 Mbps.The only cons I see is the signal strength. If I go to my next room (Just 1 wall)  the signal drops heavily and I hardly get 1 band signal. It has 2 antenna  such weak signal is not something expected.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Anmol Sinha,14 January 2018,Amazon,A solid build adsl modem+ router. Made in India gives some kind of nationalist pride😊. Using it with BSNL.Connection is steady considering my earlier TP link.

Yet to start using that.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Narinder,6 May 2016,Amazon,I m writing this review after using the device one month. This is my first Wi-Fi modem cum router. But I m fully satisfied with its performance. The device is kept in my 2nd floor drawing room of 2 BHK flat (750-800 sq fit). But there is no problem of signal anywhere in my flat. Even I can do my work from ground floor also surrounding 50 metre area. There is no heating problem at all as I m using it for almost 16 hrs per day. Obviously it's getting heated but not too much that we have to stop using the device. I m using this for BSNL Landline to Internet connection. Installation is quite easy although I had to contact with their customer care for the last step. But that's not an issue. It takes nearly 20 minutes to install. All u need is a PC with a good DVD driver. Happy Surfing....,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router,No,No

Sarthak J.,28 February 2018,Amazon,5Ghz sometimes not getting detected within same room. 5Ghz band signal very weak no range outside the room where router is kept. Used my old n class router as repeater for 802.11 N band to improve signal in other rooms for 2.4Ghz band. Probably should have gone for good models/brands.update-: Only band now works at a time. to get other band to work router must be restarted. bad quality router. seems like a waste of money. should have gone for a better expensive dual band router.,Digisol-DG-BR5400QAC-AC1200-Dual-Band-Wireless,No,No

The customer support of Digisol sucks.,Digisol-wireless-usb-adapter-DG-WN3300N,No,No
Chandru Pendyala,16 December 2017,Amazon,Range is very bad. It doesn't work well in a 500 Sq.ft Rooms. My router is in one room  my desktop with Digisol Wireless is in the other. And speed is reduced by almost 50% with doors closed. With doors open  speed reduced by 75%.- Keep your room doors open. Adjust your desktop closer to the main router. This helps.- I found it useful as it gets my work done with somewhat slower speeds. I get 20Mbps. My phones gets a speed of 20Mbps even when i stand outside my gate. But This Digisol  wireless is in the next room  and I get 12 Mbps with doors opened and around 7 mbps with doors closed. So it doesn't/cannot capture the full 20mbps speed.But I guess I can't complain much because its worth the money. If I had to buy a 'good' Wireless Card for my Desktop it would have cost me around 900-1300 bucks.As i read many comments  they tell it doesn't work well. It works very well with windows 7 & 10. Didn't try with 8 and 8.1.,Digisol-wireless-usb-adapter-DG-WN3300N,No,No

Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband:
Ravi Prakash Pandey,21 July 2018,Amazon,I have used several ADSL routers over past 12 years but this one from digisol is best of them. My location is about 3 kms from the BSNL exchange and earlier connection dropouts were common especially in summers and rainy season. But after installing this router that problem is now almost gone. In addition to that this router offers far more functionality than what BSNL issued modems provide.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Amazon Customer,26 November 2018,Amazon,The white color was not available as shown in photo but the seller immediately called me as soon as I ordered this to ask if it's okay to send black color instead.The packaging and all was very neat and good.Now let's come to main pointThe durability - the modem is very durable and small so m happy with itRange - the range of this wi fi is similar to any other modem at this range but what makes it different is it's strength signal. It's full even from 3 room next to it.Made in India - that's what I liked the most. If something is made in India n worthy of it I always buy itObviously there are cons too for example the reset button I doubt it u can press it with hand n side power button looks like made of some cheap plastic quality but I definitely suggest this to anyone looking for modem n router at this price range cuz no problems on my end 👍,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Ravi Prakash Pandey,7 November 2017,Amazon,One of the best modems that I ever Purchased. Before purchasing this I had DLink Asus but didnt get this type of performance. Very easy to Install. Now Iam having fast Internet connection and using BSNL bradbandThanks to Digisol IndiaProud to say thatIts an Indian product,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Kavita Negi,2 November 2018,Amazon,A compact & sturdy ADSL2+ modem & router.Based on the newer N series with 300 Mbps network speed.Suports 3G dongles too.Carries 3 year warranty.Been using it with  my bsnl connection via landline.Has two 5db gain antennas for better & strong connection.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Parshwanth Hegde,21 September 2018,Amazon,Configuring it took some time. The logo on the product still looks suspicious about the originality of the item. Though it is working fine.Even the web portal look different when connected through 192.168.1.1,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Neeraj Vishwakarma,24 March 2018,Amazon,So Far So Good with BSNL ADSL BB connection which is 10mbps speed. It has been week this modem has been setup. And the coverage of WiFi is pretty good also there is no connection drop issue. The modem interface is designed with web based UI and we have more options compared with other modem. Pretty good  modem made in INDIA.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Sravan (Madhu),2 January 2019,Amazon,I bought this on june 2018 and writing it on jan 2019. I think it is a good product for me. I bought this for ₹1350/-. No any issue felt but I didn't felt any serious advantage of having the second antenna  ie; I can't feel any serious boost of the wifi network in my house with the two antenna while comparing with my previous one antenna modem. Maybe it is due to wifi traveling issue in my house (have lots of walls). But like i said i didn't feel any loss of speed even though the signal strength are low. Also our devices must be capable to grab the signal very well,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
ganesh,8 July 2018,Amazon,First time ever I am really dissatisfied with the packaging of Amazon India. The box as shown in the picture is damaged. This box was just inside a Plastic Packet and no separate carton box was given by the seller in this case to protect the original device box. Amazon insists on providing original covers tags etc while accepting a return but they should look into this lackadaisical approach of packaging by the seller.Coming to the device  it works justs brilliantly with my BSNL ADSL Line. Setting it up was a breeze and it provides good speed and coverage with its two antennas. I am receiving pretty decent coverage on my first floor room as well as through out the house with the device placed at a corner room in my house.The box consists of Router device  Power adapter  a splitter for adsl line and telephone  Short RJ45 cable  two telephone cables for connecting the device.It also has a quick start guide  a installer cd with step by step instructions on how to install the device properly.Just go for it you will not repent buying this device.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No
Swali,7 August 2018,Amazon,The router is easy to set up and manage. Has three options for internet connection - ADSL  RJ45 and USB dongle support. I am using it with USB dongle at the moment and it is good for the purpose.But it does have one issue. It frequently redirects to Tata Docomo wired broadband site. At first I thought the issue is with my computer but no it happens on all my devices  all the phones and even my friends' laptops when browsing through this router. It is very annoying at times.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No

Amazon Customer,18 November 2016,Amazon,I was initially disappointed with this as it seemed to be designed for internet input through telephone line (RJ11) whereas my internet connection was through RJ45 (regular lan cable). Later I read the manual which indicated that we could connect internet to the router by inserting RJ45 cable from modem into LAN1 port of router. This did not work initially. So I called the tech support and the lady there guided me systematically through all the settings and lo... it started working like a charm. Signal strength is also very good. I've got a duplex house with router on lower floor but get good signal in upper floor also. Kudos to this made in India product.,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No

Amazon Customer,19 March 2017,Amazon,Modem-cum-router doing its job fine but a little bit disappointed as the web interface doesnt provide the USB HDD support. Although here on amazon in the product description its mentioned that it supports USB dongle and Mass storage. But in real its a deception. It doesnt support mass storage.

Jaykishore,24 July 2017,Amazon,The product is good and I am using USB 4G dongle to it that works well.

If I go to my next room (Just 1 wall)  the signal drops heavily and I hardly get 1 band signal.

Anmol Sinha,14 January 2018,Amazon,A solid build adsl modem+ router. Made in India gives some kind of nationalist pride😊. Using it with BSNL.Connection is steady considering my earlier TP link.

Narinder,6 May 2016,Amazon,I m writing this review after using the device one month. This is my first Wi-Fi modem cum router. But I m fully satisfied with its performance. The device is kept in my 2nd floor drawing room of 2 BHK flat (750-800 sq fit). But there is no problem of signal anywhere in my flat. Even I can do my work from ground floor also surrounding 50 metre area. There is no heating problem at all as I m using it for almost 16 hrs per day. Obviously it's getting heated but not too much that we have to stop using the device. I m using this for BSNL Landline to Internet connection. Installation is quite easy although I had to contact with their customer care for the last step. But that's not an issue. It takes nearly 20 minutes to install. All u need is a PC with a good DVD driver. Happy Surfing....,Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband,No,No

Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router:
Ajay S,21 May 2017,Amazon,Writing after nearly 5 months of using this router.1. Setup - Was easy & straight forward. Like almost any other router today2. Coverage - This is a bit tricky to quantify. It has nearly the same range as Cisco / Linksys E900 I was using before. But with a BIG DIFFERENCE. Once a device with Wifi-N is connected to this router  the connection remains much more stable and is a notch stronger. Speed drop is much less as distance increases. We notice this on almost all devices i.e smart phones  laptops etc. I can now sit at far ends of our home and comfortably work  instead of having to walk towards the router if I wanted use internet. HOWEVER this may not work for older devices  as a laptop with Wifi-G only  still has problems connecting when distance is more  will a Wifi-N device works flawlessly from the same spot. Do note this is still much better than E-900 as both Wifi-G and Wifi-N Would not connect to E-900 from such spots. With Digisol DG-HR3300TA  our Wifi-N devices work anywhere around the house3. Stability - This is not top-motch. Digisol requires a restart once in a day or two. The E-900 could go for weeks before we had to power cycle. We never switch off our router  so this is one aspect where Digisol is a bit weak.4. Performance - We are a gadget heavy home. And this router manages to carry the load without squeaking.Giving this router a 5 start as our Wifi-N devices work great with this  and we never want to go back to E-900  (which is still in fully working condition) though this joy is a liiiiiitle offset by the Digisol requiring more frequent power cycling. Happy with this buy,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Prabhakar,9 October 2017,Amazon,Just OK. Looks three antennas may deliver better coverage  but not so. There is no switch for WiFi on/off. There are no holes on the backside for hanging / fixing on to a wall. Just to be be used as desktop piece. Similar to all the equipment manufacturers  they provide smallest possible wire length from two pin plug adapter to router  for power supply. Same is the case with this router also.,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Ajay S,30 January 2017,Amazon,Router range is vgood however every now &then the router locks out the ip if using more than 2 devices. Every 2 days the rrouter needs to be restarted as it suddenly stops appearing in available connections. Does anyone have a clue why it does this. This never happened b4 with my tp link router,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Prabhakar,30 January 2017,Amazon,I just now received this router  so far its going good and it's very easy to setup the wireless network with it   rest I will let u guys know how is it after a week .well well now I am using this device for I guess 4 days and I m noticing signal drops in between Nd that's not a good sign for long run everything is superb but in between it drops signals and I m thinking for a replacement which I will ask for maybe tomorrow  otherwise the router is verygood and signal range is also very good for big houses,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Consumer,4 May 2017,Amazon,Bought this router 3-4 months ago ..so far working fine but i was under the impression that it will give better wifi coverage than my previous Netgear 150 mbps router which has just small antenna unlike this which has 3 5db antenna's thts quiet obvious isnt it .....but sad to say not much difference in terms of coverage its nothing special its just the same! so a bit disappointing but if you have a small house/flat thn this is a good buy for you its made in India too!!:) in my case i live in a bungalow so its got more area to cover fighting to pass through all the house walls.,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Abhinav,28 January 2017,Amazon,Coverage was so good but Wlan have some problem.When I want to connect more than 2 devices then the wlan will disabled automatically.After then if u will restart the router then u can connect only that 2 devices.Also a big disadvantage of this router -1. wifi or wlan on/off switch is not available.2. Wps light is not available. So when u want to wps connectivity  then u confuse that is it on or off..,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No

Fauzan,18 January 2019,Amazon,Don't even buy it by mistake. I have bought this from a retailer and yesterday was the first use. My connection speed is 40mbps but it was giving max 25mbps on wifi. I configured my old Huawei router and it was giving full 40mbps on wifi. I had purchased a Digisol DG-WN3300N wireless USB adapter in the past and it stopped working then I replaced it but it also stopped working,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
Amazon Customer,7 November 2016,Amazon,DELIVERY and PACKAGING:The product came in a bubble wrapped amazon pack.IN THE PACK:A Digisol router BoxIN THE BOX:- A black router- Power adapter- LAN Cable- ManualSUMMARY:Earlier I was using an ASUS single antenna router which was working great till it went bad and stopped working. I took this as an opportunity to upgrade to a high range router. The ASUS router was good  but the speeds reduced after a distance.While looking for all the options  I came across a not so famous brand Digisol. Looking in the company details  I found that this is an Indian brand with a good reputation in the Hardware sector. Since the price was comparable  I went ahead and bought the HR3300TA router.REVIEW:The main unit looks great in the matt finish. It is way better than the normal white or black routers that are available in the market. When you switch on router and the first thing you notice is that the lights on the router are blue  which completely compliments the look. The process to configure is simple and if you know which setting to enter in which screen  the setting WAN is breeze.The router settings page are easy to navigate  but misses polish. To my surprise  when you try to open the page from the mobile  there is another UI  separate from the PC version  which is mobile friendly and worked pretty well.I was a bit disappointed with the Range. The Range is better than the Single antenna router  but not as good as 3 Antenna routers. I would say it performs a bit better or may be equal to the 2 Antenna routers in terms of range.The speeds are good. The Wifi Speeds remains consistent  no matter how far you are from the router.PROS:- Great Looks.- You get a complimentary LAN cable out of the box.- The WiFi speed remains consistent even when you are far from the router.- Mobile friendly router configuration pages  which is not normally seen in other routers.- Product of an Indian company  with made in India tag.CONS:- The range is not as good as what you expect from a 3 antenna router  but comparable to 2 antenna router.- The router misses on the power button. (This I knew before buying  but still went ahead).VERDICT:After using for roughly 20 days  I would say I am not completely disappointed buying this. The Range is on the lower side  but apart from that  the product works great in all the other departments.Please Hit the “YES” button If you found this Review Helpful. It encourages me to inspect more and more products so that you could have only the Right Products,Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router,No,No
