Digisol-DG-HR3400-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband:
1: The first week of buying the router it was working fine.Then the problems started.Everyday at least thrice a day it disconnects by itself without any explanation.Only when restarting the router does it connect to the internet.It's infuriating.People please don't buy this product as you'll be cheated.I don't want people to be screwed the same way I am.

2: First of all i got it for 899/- and delivered two days before delivery date.... if u see the picture of router in amazon it looks very big.. but actual size is too small.. working fine no heating problem...I m writing this after 15 days of my usage it is working awesomely no problem i can get signals to my every corner of my room it can be wall mounted... my strong recommendation u can purchase without any hesitation

3: Guys I am using this router for more than a year it comes with life time warranty. Till then no single problem had arrived with this product. It gives good connection speed on wifi. Its perfect for small and medium home/area.PROS:#double antenna#great range ( depends upon how much walls the signal has to travel to reach from router to the device)#supports both 2.5ghz and 5ghz frequency#easy setup#portable#4 lan ports#life time warranty#good service#value for moneyCONS:#As such no cons for this product.

4: MADE IN INDIA ;)It is better than Belkin for the price range.The range is good and had no problems yet. Using it since eight months.Check for service centers nearby just in case.Received it in four days. Packaging was good.Tip: Check with your broadband before buying a router as the requirement may differ.

5: Writing this review after one year of use .This product is made in India and it is best to use the Indian product  I have been using this router for more than one year and its working like beast.* Have been using 24*7 for 365 days have never powered down.Coverage area is good it covers my whole bungalow completely as well as gives me coverage on 2nd floor as well i have installed it on 1st floor so it covers the area well.Would like to give 5 + rating for the product  guys go for it the price offered is best with two antenna router  previously used products like D-Link and i-ball router but this is best in class.

6: Overall performance is good....

7: You wouldn't find any defect till one month of use. Coverage is quite good. Sometimes I get signal at a distance of 25 meters with multiple walls blocking.But After one month use film started the wifi router started disconnecting  automatically after every 2-3 hours of use. You have to restart it to resolve the problem. Additionally  this problem is  well discussed in sevaral reviews here but Amazon still supplying faulty product to its customers.Interestingly if you try to do some R&D to resolve the disconnection problem yourselves here Digidol doesn't provide updated firmware software anywhere over Internet so you just stuck with faulty product. No customer service number working either.Howcome Amazon can claim that this product has lifelong warranty?

8: Well after a month of usage... This has got to be a crap Router. Stay away from buying anythign cheap. A Dlink or TP Link would anytime do a better job. My neighbours got the same connection (ISP) as I do but mine keeps dropping out. Its range is terrible. I would advise buyers to not look at a mere 200-300 price difference. Consider this... You are placing a sell on stocks and the connection keeps popping out and there you go your intraday loss is over 1000 as you missed the bus. Thats wht happened with me.

9: Great product at the price point we get it but only problem with it is weak in wireless repeater mode also I have two Digisol Routers out of which one had dead but can't do anything as there is no service centre being in Surat Gujarat means you can't expect service if it is having any problems but it use to work well most of the times other router had already completed warranty period of 5 years still working great

10: I have found this feedback from a Mahender Rana and its 100% true.. I am just repeating it as every word in the feedback is correct.Their very big bug in this router if you keep router continuously on then router signal singles get disconnect and router automatically get restart again and again . And also there is big bug in the firmware that when you connect you mobile devices the to pay games or watch any video from app (like jio airtel tv FIFA takken etc) you getting loading sign but it does get loaded this because of the firmware i thought this may be issues with my isp but when i cross check then i came to know their big issues in firmware .hence i request please do not buy this product

11: From 4 days I am using it......and seems to be a good product....range is good and it can cover 1200 sq feet area....

12: Product- 5/5Amazon Delivery- 3/5 ( Not that great this time)Box packaging- 4/5 (Not so premium)In box- Product with fixed tilted antenas(2) Product guide booklet driver cd( I didn't find that useful) power cable 5V 1Amp (enough long and adapter is good quality) a short lan cablesetup- Takes around 1 min ( if you have experince just connect and go to default router gateway with default id/pw then setup with isp static ip)Connection- I use 2 Lan ports and 2 mobile phones over wifi still no significant speed capping visible.Range- (The best Thing) I have 3 rooms on ground floor and 1 room on 1st floor all the rooms get equal 4 bars and lawn area get 3 bars of signal over wifi even my neighbours get 1-2 bars even they are 50-70 mts away. In a nutshell I didn't expect that.I use Alliance fibre optic broadband on ROB circle and use 8-10 mbps pack and get the exact speed on wifi and LANCompany provides 3 yrs of warrenty on main router and 1 yr of warrenty on power adapter that's good.Con- 1.Build quality not so good.  2. Fixed antenna.Verdict- Best for small home full paisa vasool Strongly recommendedP.S- I got it on amazon on Rs. 943 ( effectively 848 bcoz the upi transaction 10% cashback) that is a steal deal for me because I search that exact same model on few offline stores they demand 1250-1300.

13: This product looks very small but the impact it creates is very high. Honestly I did not expect this high performance from Digisol.I saved money by buying this low cost product and very happy with its performance.Signal never drops below 40Mbps.For me whose max speed before this was 8Mbps this is true rock stor signal performance.

14: I bought this router in Feb 2016. It gave some trouble during the initial installation. The customer support was technically knowledgeable but expected me to sit around the router all day troubleshooting it with their assistance. After eventual successful installation it worked reasonably well. The range is not particularly good. Does not work well through walls. It has now begun to fail needs to be rebooted every hour or so. I'm on the market for a new router now.

15: connection keeps dropping and when i look on the networks available my wifi is available but when i click connect its asking for password again  i type the password and it says wrong password !what i had to do was to reboot the router  then it connects fine  but this keeps happening about 3 times a day so not great

16: Pretty awesome in every which way. I get a signal even 3 floors below. Have never switched it off in 2 years!! No heating issues. Can be easily configured as a bridge or a repeater. I really like the Active client table and ability to set up temporary guest network.It unfortunately doesnt support ddwrt or openwrt. Sometimes some of my devices fail to connect even though they detect it a quick reboot solves this.

17: This is the best router which covers wide area(signals) in this price range i have used many routers like tp link  tenda  d link but no other router gives signals like this one.. i covers my whole Home  and i even get its signal in the park front of my home.my home is around (1782.72 .sq .ft)  . and the the is double of it.. also i want to mention that i am using this router from almost around 3 years  nd i have placed my router at the center of my house nd i am able to use my wifi behind 4 walls  easily.

18: Its good for the price paid. range is decent  easy to configure and setup. Has a lot of features and its definitely better than other chinese routers you can buy.Digisol needs some polishing up with their features like QOS and IP blocking URL blocking ext though . i have to reconfigure the qos like everyday.overall i'd recommend this router

19: crap product. Restarting every 5 seconds. Many people are facing same problem. Replaced product twice all have same issue. No use of replacement at service center. Don't buy this.

20: Initially work good but within 3 to 4 month start hanging. I feel so upset by purchase of Digisol. I am using it from 1 and half years but all the time i need to restart it to connect. Someday i need to do 3 to 4 times in 5 to 6 hours.

21: I bought it cz the reviews looked good  but meh. I am having issues with the range.The internet speed is not a problem but the Ping i get using this is pure trash.IF you plan to you it to download stuff at your home  its goodBut if you plan to play gaming and all  i encourage you to go with something better.I NEVER GET BELLOW 210 PING AND IF YOU ARE A GAMER YOU'LL UNDERSTAND HOW ANNOYING THAT IS.

22: Best router under 1000 works fine for meMade in indiaDouble antennaButton to off wireless radiatorLifetime warrantyYes this is that router which i want.

23: Bad product. It just cant provide me wifi to my other rooms. I have a 3 BHK apartment and the router sits in my room where my pc is and this thing and when my parents are there in there bedroom they can't access the internet. Really bad thing even after having a 13 channel and 5GHz bandwidth it still can provide wifi to whole house

24: Latest Technology Wifi but Call center support waste of time and also my hathway broadband service provider couldnt set up the wifi as per the instructions manual nor the call center support helped so ultimately i returned the product for refund.

25: Light weight compact wall mountable and offers good speed. The router is very easy to setup either manually or by using the setup guide from the  CD provided along with it. Antenna gain is 5 dbi which offers good coverage all over my home which has a floor area of around 1900 sq ft despite placing the router in the corner of my bedroom which again lies in a corner of our entire house.

26: I am Deliberately writing review one month after usage to justify it properly.1. As usual Amazon delivered product way earlier then it promised.2. RJ 45 this is requirement of most of all new Internet revive provider except Bsnl which is available in it3. Range is just beyond imagination available Even 3 bungalow away from my home.4. Rate : Cheapest deal I got at Amazon.Must buy and place it in centre of your home to cover all rooms.

27: I brought this product on advise of ACT sales guy.Must say excellent product.Got setup in a jiffy.Range is good considering I have installed this in my 1st floor home-office room and still has good wi-fi access in the master bedroom at the ground floor.Overall a not expensive and good product.

28: I am having lot of issues within 15 days of using..my internet gets disconnected after every 5 mins..worst product and I can't return in amazon now..drawback of online shopping

29: It is truly a very good product and useful as explained in the product details. I had some difficulty in installation since I wanted to use it as a booster router to the existing modem cum router. But thanks to the Digisol Technical team for assisting me in installation.I have full appreciation for Amazon for excellent packing and delivery well before the estimated date.

30: Have now been using it for a month.Setup was easy.Range is OK though I would have liked it to be better. But there so many factors that affect range.Has been stable.Product is black in color and very small compared to what it seems in the photo.Overall satisfied with this product.

31: Router was working fine with my low bandwidth connection around 5-10Mbps. But after upgrading to 1 fibre connection with 100Mbps the router hangs every now and then. And i need to restart every time. I've got 2 such product and this is a generic issue as I face it in both of them.

32: The best router... Posting review after almost 1 year of usage..I have used this as serial channel  repeater mode also... I already use tenda router.. Which doesn't support this kind of setup.. Digisol router is feature rich smooth operation with good signal strength in best price 850 round. Loved it.

33: Good product but the only issue is that sometime I feel the range is not that good. I installed it on the second floor and if I goes to first floor the connection is not that good

34: After 6 months of using it's not working well link gone several time without any reason even their customer service is unable to solve the problem.

35: Using this product for about 2 weeks now. Have to say awesome product. No hang problems awesome coverage with 2 5DB antennas. Only ine thing lacks we can not bind mac addresses of devices (to restrict unwanted access to the internet). I think there is no option with the router to do so. Other than that no issue at all!

36: one of the worst router I have ever used.I have my chrome-cast kept few inches below this router still I don't get full range most of the time.once I have 4 devices connected it takes ages to assign IP address to new devices.once you have devices connected wait for some time and it all connected devices will drop signal.

37: nice performance till 2nd year then on third year it got restarted every now & then warranty got me covered replaced it this time also the same ppen replaced it again & my problem solved

38: I repeatedly tried to confirm from the Customer Service whether the product supports the normal telephone broadband connection and each time i was answered in Affirmative. The real answer ... Dont buy this if you a RJ-11 connection (normal telephone lines). Only works with CABLE BROADBAND CONNECTION.

39: I faced so many problems sometimes it stops working at a crucial time... I feel that i had done a mistake after bought this router.. I want to replace it but the time limit is over

40: I have been using this router for last 2 months it has frequent disconnection problems even the range is also not good . Reading so many positive reviews I bought this router but highly disappointed with the product. I have hardware version d1 and feel that this has got lot of issues .  E1 is the latest one may be that one is better than d version . I would recommend to return the product if the seller has delivered lower hardware version than E1

41: Best router in comparisons with 300 Mbps tplink or d link. It has bridge & router modeMac filter20mhz / 40 MHz band choice s. Moreover signal is the the best in its class getting 2 signals at 40 metre  horizontal & 25ft vertical distance. Which other giving 1or 2 signal.. Best digisol care replied instantly after contacting. for registration...I AM USING THIS FOR 2 MONTHS. IT ALSO HAS URL BLOCK OPTION. I am using PMPL broadband at ranaghat West Bengal & working great with this.

42: The product is good you can't get a dual antenna 300MB wireless router in Rs. 900.I live in a duplex i've installed the router at second floor and i still get 1 bar if i get to the corner of first floor.It even has a lifetime warranty (WHAAAT !!!)It was easy to install totally hustle free

43: Using this for cable internet connection. Everything is good. One star less since the range is not good for a big house. But still it covers all rooms in a 2BHK but sometimes loses the signal at far end other room. I need to go near catch the signal and then come back to work :)

44: It works good. However not so flexible. The antenna or whatever they call it is not unidirectional and only move one side. But it's a Indian so that's more than we can expect. However works great and found no problem yet. Good product.

45: Bought it for my office. I set it up myself. I have 4 computers connected on LAN and about 4 to 5 mobiles on the Wifi. Coverage is great and have faced good speeds though speed is dependent on the service provider.

46: Very Good Router..I am using it since a week and have not found a single con.It has amazing range and gets connected easily.Amazing speed !

47: This Router I have been using it over a Month... An ace product.. As they promised they delivered... Connects easily from 4th Floor to Ground and even in some area circumference around.... TOTAL WORTH YOUR MONEY... Upon that the product is Made in India and Compact... Not any chinese jokes...!!!

48: This is far more better than i expected... Range is quite good well best in this range and above it gives 74mbs on wifi... Working good as of now. Easy to setup

49: Writing this review after almost 6 months of purchase. Frequent connection drops. Laptop can connect but difficulty in mobile recognition. Tried the solution from customer care but their solution could not help. Scrapping this product. So tiered that do not even want to claim warranty. Will go for D-Link...

50: Excellent product for its cost. I am using it as a repeater in my house. Setup was simple. But please remember the "Lifetime warranty" is actually 5 years.... I don't understand why you need such marketing gimmicks when the product is good.

51: Excellent product for home users. Guys this product is sold for 958 as a big billion day offer on flipkart. The one reason why I chose amazon is for there returns policy. You can trust amazon on this. Don't go with flipkart. All fraudulent people are running it. The setup and stuff is lot easier for this router and signal is good as well.

52: Sometimes the connection drops. Probably because I am using more than 5 devices. But that is way more than You can expect at 1K. A brilliant product for something that is made in India. Set up is easy. A good Buy for a 1 BHK house.

53: We purchased this to support made in India product!  The price is very competitive less than other leading brands . The signal strength is very good for a 1000 ft.² apartment and also 2 floors down.

54: Works OK as expected range is enough yo cover 2bhk with minimal signal loss. They are advertising as made in India but their charger is still chinese. common digisol dispose off the Chinese items

55: Product is very good but if you have internet connection(>20Mbps) then go for some other router as it freezes every time and makes lots of packet lossmy conn.50Mbpsso go for some good ones

56: very good. as expected.good performance with railwire broadband connection. go for it. multi purpose too.

57: Awesome product.. signal strength is awesome very easy to configure5 better than belkin and the main reason to prepare this is made in indiawith lifetime warranty that is 5 years warranty after the model has been discontinued minimum 5 years of warranty will be given

58: Good quality. Laking few imp function in comparision to reputed brands. 1 imp thing missing there is no change in led color to indicate there is net connected or not.

59: Many problems with this product. Sudden speed drops so which makes you to keep changing the channels every now and then. The other problems are range /coverage  is poor

60: Sweet as sugar! don't understand a thing about its technical specifications but it worked flawlessly even when I connected two laptops and two mobile phones all at  the same time. Best value for money product in its range. People wanting to buy it just go for it without any second thoughts. Kudos to this Indian made product.

61: Value for Money. Works well in a 1200 sq ft space. Go for it . Surely product doesnt disappoint at all. Make in India rocks. Way 2 go !!!

62: Very nice router ....Easy to install/configure within 2minutes & above all range of wifi is tremendous  ......Worth for money invested...last but not the least Delivery service is very prompt of amazon.in ....Thanks amazon for such fastest delivery & such great product in very low price.

63: Range is good.. but the ping issue is there with this router. Doesn't come down below 250-280. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR GAMING

64: Nothing to complain. works as described. easy installation . got it up and running in miNutes. no speed drops. recommended.

65: Best route in this pricerange ....cover my 2 storey house....and gives coverage across road....my isp speed is 4 mbps so i dnt have speed problem... setting up was tricky but their helpline was very helpful.... and above all lifetime warranty.... go for it guys....

66: Working review:  purchased it two years back. Working flawlessly.

67: Rapid delivery from amazon with same day shipment dispatch. Product came with proper packaging. Installation was easy and straightforward. 2 antennas do not increase any wifi reception range. It is almost same as dlink's single antenna router' range.

68: Speed is totally inconsistent configuring seems simple but its not even after securing it with a password devices are able to connect without authentication

69: item received on time and safe

70: amazing product... i use it 24*7 and didn't see any problem yet with the deviceplus it is made in india and gives lifetime warrenty.. i think you should go for it and best range you will never get issues for network range

71: The router still hangs very pften I purchased this one thinking it will not hang as my previous one. But no relief.

72: Nice One. Go for it. Just one thing. If you guys are trying to hang the router in the wall it wont work coz the holes that is there in the router is very shallow and wont sit in the hangers. Most of us do not nail the wall and will be using stick type wall hangers. On that case it cant be hanged.

73: Recent product from the Digisol.Working fine after 1 year too..Recommended to others.

74: I have been using this router for the last 6 months and I am glad to say that it's a very good router indeed.As always Amazon did a good delivery job.Pros:1.good overall signal strength2.no connectivity problems3.area coverage4.no heating problem5.maintenance free6.very low power consumptionCons:Nothing much

75: The WiFi does not get connected automatically to the laptop every single time I have to search for the network & enter credentials. It doesn't work with the phone either. Shows the status as connected but no internet.Suggest you not to buy!

76: a good product. Used on G broadband with 25MBPS & on IoN broadband with 50 MBPS speed connection. Speed is constant. And product is within budget.

77: A good one. I am using BSNL broadband connection and the router has been configured to work with my i-Ball Baton ADSL2+ modem router. The range is excellent in the ground floor where the router is kept. I have reduced a star because the wifi strength is so weak in my first floor rooms and net is not accessible there.

78: Totally meet the expectation....On time delivery....Product is good didn't find any trouble connecting it to LAN working just perfectly.It is small in size can fit in your palm so can be kept anywhere without requiring extra space.

79: Made In India.Just setteled one time. And its been 6 months but not a single problem faced by me.

80: Works well when placed in the center of a small 2BR apartment. If it is in one corner then the signal strength cannot compete with the neighbor's at the other end of the apartment.

81: Yea it is really giod product and it keeps worth

82: The range of WIFI is not goodMy single antenna WiFi was same as this double antenna.i change it to get more coverage .but didn't get that.

83: Simply superb. I did quite a bit of research and ordered in view of low price. Getting blazing speed with Act fibre

84: amazing product... I love it. Great product in this price. you can configure with your smart phone so easy and compatible. it aso provide multiple ID for multiple user. I am using You Broadband with this router with great speed.

85: Doing its job flawlessly... Happy with the purchase...  Reviewing after a constant use of 10 months... great !

86: Great product! Wifi range is superb. The double antenna really makes a difference.The only issue I faced was in the initial setup where I struggled to connect to the router on it address 192.168.2.1. But once setup it's a charm.

87: This is a good router but doesn't give WIFI connectivity immediately I had to push the WPS button many times before I got the access.

88: A good and very useful WIFI router which i am  using for my ACT broadband fibrenet..The installation with the enclosed CD is quite easy and the signal within the house is satisfactory.

89: A great router at this price point. Didn't charged for delivery. Got a fast delivery. Now using it for more than a month. No such heating issue. WiFi range is good considering the price point. Another great thing - made in India. I'll say true value for money.

90: Wifi coverage is good.Light weight easy to move and small in size which is helpful in not crowding my desktop/

91: The product is completely different from the pics shown on the site. the range of this router is limited to my two bedrooms and does not catch even one stroke in my living room. My house is approx 700 sq.ft. Not worth at all. do not buy just because it has 5 years warranty. the product is useless.

92: I have been using it since more than 15 months without any problem..Awesome product

93: Nice Product. Very easy to set up. One extra feature is we can use it as repeter also. Price wise and feature wise its very good. But as very one mentation its cover for wide range i dont agree. Range its almost same as other router.

94: Working well it's idle for three four rooms good signals fast  connecting with five devices but maintains the same speed

95: A good router for home purpose...having a fair range also...go for it...But have to do some internal short range settings if u want constant speed all over the place....not everyone knows it....

96: Works perfectly fine. Can have seperate said for guests.  Just need to know if we can restrict bandwidth for guest rseu.

97: Day 1 review: Cost effective purchase.After a month:Frequent connection drop. Need to restart router now and then.avoid!!

98: your  this  product  was  damaged  and  not  working  working  this  product

99: Product is working as per expectations.. Amazing service deliveryvas always. Just a problem every time I have to reboot the router before starting up. Probably need to contact digisol cust service team...

100: Good

101: Proud to be the owner of a Made in India Indian brand. Very good receptivity so far. It's only been two months but it looks slick works well and makes me happy.

102: I have purchased "Digisol DG-HR3400 300 MBPS  wireless broadband home router" .  This product is not functioning.  This product is under warranty.  Please exchange the item.

103: No looking back after buying this router 100% satisfied. Not a single problem until now and I've been using it for 2-3 weeks now!! Good plastics used overall I feel this is the best router currently available in the market. Waay better than TP-Link go for it!

104: Working as expected

105: It's a good System.It covers my entire 1500 sq ft area.I am living in second floor but I can still connect my phone from the ground floor itself.Build quality is also good.Most Important - Lifetime Warranty. Made in India Product !!

106: i hate it because this product is not working well and because of this router my net speed become slow....

107: Working good and range is also good. No disconnectionsproduct working as described. good product at low price.wifi range is good.

108: Nice

109: Digisol DG-HR3400 300 Mbps is great router.WiFi range is very good and it covered my entire 1bhk home. Everywhere full signal. I paid only 830 bucks for that thanks amzon....

110: The product arrived properly packed. Setting it up was an ease. It is working exceptionally well.

111: This router is overall a great product. I'm proud that such a quality product is 'Made In India' as well. The only problem I faced is setting it up took a lot of time.

112: Stopped working just after a year I bout from this seller and I am not able to find any contact detail or any way to contact this person for warranty.This device is useless now.

113: Noot good ... Retured

114: BAD PRODUCTObserved wireless transmission drops in new product & even after RMA issue remain same.Looks like hardware design issue or poor quality.Finally i have purchased D-link

115: Good product value for money

116: Superb product never expect this much performance blindly jus go for digisol wifi router and range of the wifi is extremely excellent

117: Decent but not great.  Does not have WPS button. I dont signals in my bedroom of a 2BHK flat.I had to purchase a repeater for that.

118: Good product...No heating issues even when using for 24*7..Go for it...

119: The range is nice the product is light does not heat up good packaging. I am using this for 3 months now. Cheap and nice

120: Do not buy it.. signal is good but many times its resets automatic. it`s very problematic.. another thing is it gives only 3years warranty... so don`t buy  it.. go for tp link or d link..

121: This product is good. Working fine. Updating Review after using 2 Months. Again will update if see any issues.

122: It never works well. It works only when it feels like which doesn't make any sense because its a router. It wont work even if you try resetting it to factory settings. Do not buy.

123: flop routersignals keep breakinghas to switch it off for five minutes twice a daygetting hot regularlyi think some positive reviews on it is doubtful...i is total crapi have placed order again for dlink ..dissapointed

129: Good product with a decent wifi rangeGood product with a decent wifi range. Covers ground nd first floor to max extent.

130: Don't go for it. Unless you've modern . Otherwise it's useless. I took broadband connection and thought this will serve my purpose with it's good speed but alas! Buy DGSL models in this situation .

131: Good

132: REALLY VALUE FOR MONEY....i got this product in one day really it very good covers my whole house and having a great and strong wifi range.DIGISOL is an indian product and really a good product and having great value for money.having 3lifetime warranty is great deal.

735: I bought this only for rs 825. After using 2.5 months I would say This router is definitely the best Indian made router and its beats all other chines brand available in this range. My house is three story house and I place my router in the ground floor and its cover all over the house even with 1 signal bar u wont face any lag on Internet speed and no heating Issue even 1 day continues uses. My friend have  "D Link DIR 615" but its cover second floor only and he face some signal drops and its feels heat after a long use.If u r a new to router use then this router is easy to install no need to install the software CD provided only call on the toll free no. given on the box and they will help u step by step. So If u have tight budget then this is the best router on this range go for it.

736: Digisol DG-HR3400 300Mbps Wireless Broadband Home RouterI got this product on aug-25 and after using the one month I am writing this review.Awesome product (HOME ROUTER DG-HR3400 300Mbps) from Digisol Company. That comes with LIFE TIME WARRENT{5-years} under MADE IN INDIA tag that makes it cool buy product guys. I am using this product from last month and I didn’t face any single issue till now may be not in future also.The DG-HR3400 router shows its best performance and nearly beat up the all Chinese wifi router products. Considering the price point it outperformed. It support RJ-45 port only.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BOX CONTAINS: 1.Router with fixed 5dBi dual antenna one amp AC power Adapter Software installation CD Quick installation guide one patch card.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~PRODUCT DESIGN:  The body made by plasticglows of LED lights are crisp and bright.Size wise router is handy and smallwidth of router is equal to width of 10/20rs note(lots of space is saved in my desk).Back side contains fixed 5dBi dual antenna 1*WAN port (10/100Mbps) 4*LAN ports (10/100Mbps).Right side contains  AC power connector Power ON/OFF Button WPS/WIFI push button RESET button .Front side contains the LED indicators for power WAN LAN(1-4)WLANWPS.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SETUP &SERVICE: Digisol is easy to install and initial setup and if you got any problem then contact to toll free customer care they are very friendly and they will guide you for the product setup.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PERFORMANCE: I bought this router with little bit doubts but after using it’s proved me wrong.>No heating problem.>The range og the router was very good it’s signals fully covers my 1200sq.ft 3BHK flat my flat is in 2nd floor but my friends in 1st floor below my flat and 3rd floor above my flat are enjoying the free internet of mine.>There is no signal loss and no slow network connection.>The router was connected to 4 devices (1PC [through LAN] 1LAPTOP 2 SAMSUNG SMARTPHONES)  and all devices getting strong network signals.>Speed- I am using D-voiS fibre internet connection of 4Mbps and in speedtest.net am getting nearly full of my ISP’s Speedi.e.4Mbps.>Standard compliance-IEEE 802.3/3u 10Base-T/TX IEEE 802.11b/g/n.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~FEATURES:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~>The UI is very simple with classic look (Its need to be improved here).>FIREWALL & DoS SECURITY.>Parental Controls.>Supports for multiple SSID WIFI networks and multiple Guest networks.>URL & IP FILTERING.>Active clients list and MAC binding.>Wireless repeater -you can also use this as a wi-fi repeater if you searching for any repeater and you should go for this.> and also many other bunch of features Considering the price its offers the features which normally comes in the above 1200/-rs Devices.###############################################################################################Pros:  >GOOD TECH SUPPORT FROM COMPANY. >Low budget router. >Act as wi-fi repeater. >Support for multiple guest networks. >Data stream control. >Parental control. >Strong WIFI Coverage area. >No heating and power cycle issues.Cons: >Poor classic UI. >No bandwidth control for guest networks.``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````CONCLUSION: The digisol offering total fully loaded features in just RS-948 UPDATED PRICE-RS-897/-Without second thought you can go for this instead of wasting money in those high priced Chinese routers with bad service GO and PLACE YOUR ORDER NOW AND SAVE YOUR MONEY.

737: The best router so far I have used compared to Iball CISCO and Hwuwaei. I had some problems with speed and my ISP told me to check my router. Called up the customer care of Digisol and they resolved the problem in just 5 mins. Very professional service. Now I have been using this router for almost one year and can confidently say that so far as performance and durability is concerned it is very good. Infact at this price it performs much much better than netgear and cisco routers. Do not hesitate to buy. On top of it Digisol gives a lifetime warranty.

738: Best router at this price. Previously I was using Netgear JWNR2010 but I lost it whle shifting and bought this. I must say the performace is really good. GO FOR THE INDIAN BRAND. Worth every penny. Im using this with Fivenet can be used with Fiber connections (ACT etc.) which use RJ45 slot for internet auto login feature works perfect.Got delivery in just 12 hours.

739: One word excellent. I wanted to make my lg smart TV connect with Internet and access Nas drive content without running cables across rooms. I already had asus router configured as router to which isp cable and Nas drives were connected to in main room.  However my smart TV doesn't have wifi and located in  another room with no option to connect to main router without running wires.This Digisol router kept near my TV it was very easy to setup as repeater in no time and TV connected to it thru Lan cable . Lg recommends their wifi dongle which I find as tad expensive and less functional compared to fully functional router like this one .  Problem solved. Plus was my wifi range also got extended. Router interface is clean functional easy to use and pretty fast with good speed and signal strength in a clean lean design and very good price point.Now need to see how reliable is this product.

740: Based on my limited use of this router -Range: Very good signal at the extreme ends inside my 3BHK apartment (even with two walls and a closed door inbetween)Speed: I was able to get full down and up speeds without any noticeable packet loss (Had linksys - cisco router which was dropping packets very bad)Setup details: There are little bits of setup glitches which can be overcome with a bit of trial and error.Stability: Since the setup I have not seen a single connection drop.Above all those its a 'Made in India' product that really is better than the chinese routers priced 1500 - 2000

741: at this Price You Get Access Point + Repeater . Seriously Folks there is nothing much you would Expect.Range ? At Part with any likes of Tp-link or D-Link stuff that costs upto 3K. You wont be getting anything better than this DIGISOL.Build Quality is nice - and LED light notification is Super Bright.Only reason giving 4 star - UI or Configuration Page requires some Work for sure - not Well Organized and Options are not in a FLOW.that said instead of buying a Wifi Long range or whatever Wifi Router better Buy this Product and Extend your Wifi.Go for it  there is nothing you gonna Lose in this its gonna Satisfy you more than Anticipated.

742: A good product to buy.The chassis quality can be better.Light weighted as I am a network guy loved to play with its features.I don't know whether other devices have this facility or not but u can easily configure the setting through your phone or laptop wirelessly.It gave me the complete authority over the number of users.You can immediately block a person just while casually using you phone.So no unwanted friends or guest over using or misusing your internet.A small disappointment because the url blocking feature is not working.Still satisfied with the product.

743: Installed 2 days ago. Working well.  Installation was easy with little help from google about how to enable DHCP in laptop to configure the sytem.Very fast.  Signal strength is very good.  Placed in hall of the ground floor. Reaching all the places. signal is reaching to the  the separate room which is on the first floor even after closing the door.Picture posted here looks little bigger than the actual device. Not sure about the build quality whether it will break if it falls.Worth for the price.  One start less because package was shipped 3 days after the order is placed on Amazon and after that it came in just 3 days.It might be a problem from Amazon side.  Also Amazon was displaying a message that product would be delivered within 2 days(Tuesday) if order placed in 20 hours. I got it on Friday.

744: This router is just awesome compact in size smallest in comparison to all the routers i used before.Setup is easy and the customer support executive will help you to setup they are very polite and resolve all doubts regarding the product. I live in 2nd floor of 1500sq house and the range of this router is at every corner of my house from ground floor to terrace. My model of router is DH-HR3400(HW-E1) This is the latest model.I am using it from lasr 10 days non stop no heating problem. Before this i also used TP link and D link but both gives poor range so i strongly recommend this Digisol Indian Company and pickup centre is also at my hometown for services.Mazaaa aa gaya yeh leke  value for money i bought it at 999/- Exceptionally best router in India now for Home users.

745: This INDIAN Product.. is By Far The Best Indian Product in Recent Times... I hve Been Using this For 10-12 Days Now.. nd i haven't Faced Any Difficulty at All With This.... This Runs 24x7 without Any Interruption... This Product is Better Than Tp-link nd D-link's Same Range Router... Because I Hve Used Both Of them.. Everything Is Almost Similar To them.. bt The Range Of this Router Is THE BEST... My House Is 2 storey.. Its A Wide house.. Nd My Room is on One Corner Downstairs.. nd If I Go To upstairs To the opposite Corner.. i still get Atleast 2-3 bars... which is Excellent.. I m Totally Satisfied With Customer service Of Digisol... As I was facing Problem Installing it.. they Helped me Very Humbly n Resolved it In Minutes... On Whole I m Totally Satisfied With This Product..RANGE 10/10 ' ... #MakeinIndia

746: Replaced my TPLINK modem as I had to reboot it everyday as the speed was getting slower. Digisol is doing a fantastic job was easy to install and there hasn't been a reason to reboot. Range is fantastic too the router is placed in a corner of my bedroom and I get full range across my entire flat.

747: Amazing router-  it's got good build quality user-friendly interface and awesome signal strength as well.I recommend you get this if you're using ACT broadband - my new connection was instantly loaded when they plugged in the broadband cable.

748: No issues with the product. Works great as long as it works. I had a digisol router previously and judging from my previous experience this was my second device ordered from Amazon. I'm all for "make in india". This one stopped working  after 2 months and hence started the painful phase of getting the device repaired/replaced. After couple of hour long phone calls and a visit to the local service center I'm still stuck with this lemon. This is the first time I'm dealing with their after sales service and it's disgraceful. It's been almost 2 weeks and still they cannot get a replacement device. In today's world it's not easy to go by without WiFi at home and this ordeal is almost forcing me to buy a standby router which I don't want to pay for. Lifetime warranty doesn't mean anything if it takes a lifetime to get your faulty device replaced.

749: Initially I was skeptical of buying this router from Digisol as I was not sure about its performance and i had seen none of my friends ever using this brand. After a lot of comparison i thought of taking a gamble and going for an indian brand.  Trust me that was the best decision made i got this one for 999rs.  from Amazon which was an amazing deal. Now coming to the pros-1. Sleek body with green led lights.2. Better looking than any other high end routers which cost way more than this.3. Better/Comparable signal strength than most trusted brands( Based on personal experience i was using Cisco linksys before buying this one.) due to dual antenna.4. 5 year warranty.  But havent tried the customer service.  For me it doesn't matter because this router is rock solid and for the price it is available i cant think of any reason not to buy it.No cons.Overall a great purchase :)

750: Wi-Fi range is awesome proud of this Indian product. Previously I had D-Link router which is only 40% of Digisol.I am getting full range in my 2 BHK flat 1080 sqf. My flat is on 5th floor I have tested range at ground floor below our balcony its full range.It has feature to block unwanted websites also. It is easy to setup.Cons: The LAN cable provided with this router is not good quality...but it was not important for me.

751: Slow browsing speed and when I connect a phone it stops working. Then I have to turn off the router and turn it back on in order for internet to work.

752: Very very good product.it covers our whole two storied building(even rooftop) and the connection never drops.internet speed is good.no heating issue even after two days of continuous use:)

753: Wonderful Router <3 Loving it !

754: the router works like magic guys it can work as a router. Repeater. Nd extender.All 3 modes in 1 wifi routerNetwork range is great. Has set up on 1 st floor nd range comes to 2 nd floor ground floor nd even on the road outside.. Astonished... But it takes time to auto connect to the device

755: I have been using Digisol modems and routers since around 6 years now. I prefer Digisol over others as I believe their products offer the best value for money. It is the perfect balance between price and quality.I have two of these one in my home and another in my small office. and they do their job well. No complaints whatsoever during the last 5 months that I have been using these routers.The coverage is pretty goodIt is simple and easy to setup and manage. You do not have to be a networking pro to set up or manage this one.I think it is a perfect router for home or small offices. and for that price trust me it's a steal

756: Hi I have just brought this router Itrout has a very good look sleek design and best part it is very light and it's range is awesome i have a bit Confusion about TP link and D link routers but afterAll my research I choose this routerWell the above is boring part1.look wise 10/102.range wise10/103.speed depending upon your broad band speed provided 10/10After all this what you want better than this

757: Satisfied with the price and quality of the product. But the wireless is a problem for windows 10 devices such as my laptop. Need an update for this problem. Hope digisol stays up to date with the latest technology and does keep up the reputation of  'Make in India' slogan.

758: WOrks very well. And the range is very good covers a house of 2bhk from corner to corner with good speed that it actully gets from the antenna 👍🏻. Loved the product the delivery. Happy to use an Indian product. 😊

759: Good: Excellent range and signal quality. Cheap. Compact and sleek.Bad: 1. WPS just doesn't work PIN mode or push button mode no use. I do have another router and it works.2. Signal isolation option also doesn't help with interference.3. Heating issue although not sure it affected the performance.

760: Actually the range is limited.. 300Mbps which I am not getting. And another issue is that it disconnect in the middle... I am not getting constant connection..

761: Works flawlessly with GTPL Broadband connection (GTPL-Hathway in Gujarat)Product is very well & buy it if you require good Wifi connectivity in larger room...Works good ! nice build quality buy it..Thanks amazon for the great service as always !

762: Before buying this one I had bought TP-Link router since it was defective I had to return it. Then I bought this one which worked perfectly.Pros:- Small size (I wonder if digisol can fit all the hardware in this size then why other routers are so big in size??)- Lifetime warranty- Manual Mac address- good rangeCons:- TP Link's router had one unique feature - whenever the internet is down from ISP side the led will turn to orange and when the internet is available it will turn into green. I will miss that feature in this router.- No app support like TP-Link.- Packaging was OK.

763: Amazing product by DigisolWhile purchasing i was a bit nervous because i have never heard about this company before and it's an indian company but after using it for like 2 months ..Totally satisfied with it's qualityGo for it totally worth it( + ) points- looks amazing ( leds specially )- quality product- covrage more than any other routor available in same range- 4 portsJust a lan cable could have been a bit longerOtherwise awesome product

764: Happy to purchase this router. I have used Netgear D-Link and many other brands. This is a real good find.

765: bad experience with this product. not getting constant connection...have to reboot it every time to get the connectivity..planing to return this product

766: Worth product for the price. I am using this for nearly 6 months with BSNL FTTH (Fiber optic) connection  without any issues and here are some of my observations.Pros:1. Range is good covers an area of about 30-35 feet radius.2. Stable signal strength.3. Starts quickly within 10 seconds from switch on you will be able to connect and use it.(I am using it as a additional router as my modem doesn't have WIFI router built in it)4. Easy to setup and configureCons:1. Range could have been better.Recommended  for

767: Thanks Amazon for delivery before the time. Writing this review after the usage of 10 days. I live in 2000 sq ft house and this product is providing good range in each corner. Also I am getting range on first floor. Very good product with life time warranty. I proud that India has developed such products at very cheap price. "Value of mobey"

768: Worst router ever... the range is good no doubt... but there is a huge problem with the connectivity speed and quality of this router... many times whatsapp msg wont get delivered..  a single tick to the whatsapp msg sent takes long... ping has increased.. usually my ping is 30ms..This router is making to 400ms ping..Dont buy.. retutning after checking it more for 3-4 days

769: Superb router it's such a good and effective product more than my expectations.Initially i thought it will have range around 1000 sq.ft.but when  i have installed router on first floor i got range till third floor and even full range in my apartment parking.

770: The quality &Look ofnthe product is OK...But the connector cable which came with this is cheapest in quality i connected to my Lap for configuration and after that I tried to disconnect and I need to pull soooooo hard ...

771: I bought this Product after reviewing  the rating on Amazon. I was excited as it says its made in India. But I think i have been ripped off. As the product says it has a good range but infact the wifi range is very poor. The wifi range drops very badly once moved 10 steps away from the router. As a Genuine Indian citizen I am feeding in a genuine feed back to all the Amazon buyers out there. I still doubt the genuinity of the rating. Please be careful and research first from other sources and take a step.Ajay

772: The range of this router is simply amazing. To give you a perspective I stay on the 2nd floor and I get reception/network even at the garden when I'm gone for a quick walk. Loved this router. A must buy for larger homes though I don't live in one but my consideration to buy this was to only to get good/consistent network and not loose range because of the walls.

773: I have been using this device for almost 4 months.I just purchased it by seeing good feedback but device is not up to the mark. It won't cover much area.Please think twice before purchasing.. not worth

774: Bought few months back and its working perfectly. .....range is also very good....reasonable and met my expectations till now....

775: Works Great up to two floors with less number of obstructing walls. Its been running for a year Non Strop with same consistency. Doesn't lose signal strength.

776: Very good product.the only setback is it needs a router to convertIts a simple wireless routerI keep this ON forever. When power is not there generator switches on and back to power on it switches on real quick. No worries keeping it ON.Range is not bad. I live in a 1500 sft 3bhk flat. I am able to reach the wifi on mobile / laptop from every corner of my house.Speed through this is very nice. My fibre cable connected to this wifi has a speed of 50 Mbps. Through wifi I get 49Mbps. Not bad.

777: I am using this product for last 1 week and my experience is very satisfactory.Reason for good rating1. Good range2. Signal stability is perfect3. Nice look4. Easy to install5. Easy to put up on wallJust go for it!!!!

778: Hi friendsI bought this router before one month with confusions..But I am clear.. This one is a good product only.. There is not distortion is speed. What ever the speed i got using from LAN cable the same only i am getting through this router also..I didnt not check the range. because I am using this in my room only. however i hope it might have decent range..

779: My single antenna Dlink router was better than this. Due to delayI was not able to return the product.Kindly dont believe in fake reviews and dont buy.Tplink 2 antenna are much better

780: Its been first day but it was easy to install and use and i was getting all towers in all room as my house is of 2000sqft. So overall till now everything is fine. INDIA rocks and indian made product.

781: This router doesn't work with BSNL broadband connection. After all setup it says DNS server is not responding and hence internet connection could not be established.

782: I returned the product beacuse of random reboots. Maybe the product is gd mine wasn't. But rather rather suggest to go for tp link in this price range

783: I used this with my Tikona Broadband - Chennai. Works well.

784: ordered at 11 AM got it delivered at 5 PM.Range is good for my duplex flat.Made in INDIA!

785: Working perfectly fine. Value for money. We are using in an office env for a hall of about 25x30ft. Good WiFi coverage all through.

786: Better than my experience with D-Link router

787: Normal kind of device over heating issue low signal problem two antenas just for display

788: Superb coverage....no heating problem.....very compact in design....I am fully recommanded for it....Overall excellent product...

789: excellent performance with life time warranty

790: Very good product.easiest setupuninterrupted signalwide rangestylish look.

791: I have taken for Tikona 4mbps and it is working well as per expectations.

792: Using for last 6 months just works like a beast and never gave any chance for complaints.

793: Not working properly. It keep restarting every 2 min.

794: Worth to buy good performance and service

795: not well supported feature. Digisol is not good routeri ball is better than this

796: Awesome product from an Indian company.

797: Good product

798: Very wk signals. And too much disconnection. Ping loss too much.

799: Good product with lifetime warranty. It was not functioning in WAN mode after five days. The online support from DIGISOL was praiseworthy who spent more than two hours to resolve the issue. When it could not be done I was advised to return the product another bold move. But I am quite sure it must be some setting issue and the defective product. Though I have returned the product I would like to give FOUR STARS for its performance support from company and the life-time warranty assurance.

800: Good product at less price... Giving review after 4 months... Product working very nice... Till I not face any problems...Packing by Amazon was also good..!

801: Too good

802: Very good product with stability .I have been using it for more than one year and even keep it on for whole day.Not even a single problem till now.best product for reasonable price.

803: I just want to say that its very excellent product and 100% satisfied service.

804: Worst router

805: No person have come to receive my product

806: I like it as its still working supper!!!

807: Very nice product.....compact compare than other router and very high performance.......

808: It's an amazing product. I had my own doubts before I purchased this but so many positive reviews here on Amazon have compelled me to go for it. Was using a Belkin router 150 MBPS but honestly I never experienced the speed and the range that I experienced on this. My ISP is Act Corp Internet(Beam Tele) at 40 MBPS speed. I was completely dumbstruck at the speed I was getting on Digisol. All the apps on my mobile and the tablet are opening in fractions of seconds which is at least 4-5 times faster than my old router. Coming to the range none of the phones in the last few years have caught the wifi signal in my bedroom where the signals from the router has to pass through two heavy walls. I always had to come out of the room or switch on to 3G/4G to browse in my room. But after installing this router I'm getting the wifi signals in those spots of the room where I never got any in all these years and that too with amazing speeds. In fact I was really surprised if this is what the speed is. This router is a  perfect justice for the 40 MBPS Interet unlike my old one. Thanks for all the positive reviews on Amazon that helped me making my decision.

809: Very good product.

810: ok satisfied working good

811: I was having a German 150mbps router. Online streaming was a disaster and I wasn't doing justification with my broadband speed either. I hadn't heard of Digisol before so was kind of reluctant to buy it. I bought it because reviews were okay and it was made in India.It was very easy to install. Now I have no issues with HD streaming and Air play.I recommend this product.

812: Awesome product delivered by amazon 1 day before ...range awesome frequency perfect best budget router # believe in make in India..

813: Good one

814: Super pathetic low budget router nothing else. It stopped working within 15 days . Not a good range  when compared to dlink which was with 1 antenna

815: Nice

816: its the real McCoy ! no doubt ..the product delivers as promised.

817: Excellent Value for money

818: U van use this product an extension in ur Wi-Fi range.Best productBest DeliveryBest service

819: Best good range

820: Best router I ever seen   largest range

821: Modem is tiny and working fine.

822: Best router.

823: Dont buy this product

824: Good product..

825: Excellent

826: Signal strength is very poor..

827: Nice product but I had difficulty while installation in Ubuntu OS. There's no proper way for setup has mentioned for ubuntu the cd came along with was for Windows. Well it's quite easy to set up if you know the steps. May be this will apply even for other OS I'll explain here.Steps:1. Connect your cable provided from isp to router's blue port.2. Using the provided Lan cable in box connect router (one of yellow port) and your laptop. Don't forget to power on router. Now you should be able to access Internet in your laptop via wired connection.3. In laptop open browser and enter HTTP : / / 192 .  168 . 2 . 1 (all in lower case without space in between )4. Enter username as admin and password as 12345. Now go to setup tab in the opened link and proceed with the on screen guidelines to set up your wifi.

828: Waste

829: good product

830: Router is good but it is consuming a lot of electricity

831: My recommendation is don't buy. In fact I recommend not buying any brand that isn't listed on DD-WRT's website. Even if you don't install custom firmware support for DD-WRT shows that a product has standard predictable behaviour well-understood by the tech community. An expert once said on Digit forums "Search for digisol in Google. Then search for tplink or asus. Notice the difference."As for this particular piece of hardware I don't know how it got so many good reviews For me it's been nothing but trouble. For starters when I switched from Linksys to Digisol keeping the same SSID and same password none of my wireless devices could join the network. I had to manually make them all join again first by forgetting the SSID then re-entering the same SSID and same password. When I had replaced my earlier Netgear G router with the Linksys the transition was seamless. And now when I replaced the HR3400 with a TP-Link WR841N the transition was seamless again. Every device immediately joined the SSID without prompting.Secondly I said in an earlier review that Samsung S4 S5 and S6 models couldn't rejoin the SSID if they left the room for even 15 minutes. Just to make them rejoin the SSID I had to reboot the HR3400. The problem was getting worse. More mobile devices started getting expelled from the network. How many times am I going to reboot the router in a day??I could perhaps have solved these problems with DD-WRT but there's no chipset information about this router on Smart Link's website or anywhere else on the Internet. Another reason to stay with popular models of big brands.Update 2019: I switched off the radios and used it as a wired switch. Sad to say even as that it behaves totally unpredictably. Connections keep dropping until I reboot. It works well for a few days then lather rinse repeat...Hola Amazon we await the negative-rating feature.

832: Excellent range

833: Best

834: Goooooood and original

835: Good router @ best price

836: Dear sir product was I have inconvenience Bly choosen that's why I have to return it.

837: Superb as expected

838: No issues easy to install working satisfactorily

839: Hello Friends  Purchased this product just 2 days back after reading all the positive feedback on the same(gotta confess  was a bit skeptical in the beginning but nonetheless went for it). As always  delivery by Amazon was on the promised date & the packing was nice & sturdy.Lemme just inform u guys that for the past 2 yrs I had a Netgear N300 JWNR2000 router  & hence the skeptism for the switch. :)To cut the long story short  after easy installation  this router works just terrific & the area coverage is just awesome.The reason am saying this is bcoz  the signal strength of my earlier router was confined only to the room where it was installed  anything beyond 15 feet & the signal would disappear :(As for Digisol  this make in India product  it covers the entire house  yes  u read it correctly  the entire house ( 850 sq feet carpet area ) without hardly any compromise on the signal strength.Now  I can sit at any corner of my home & browse effortlessly without having to bother with the issue of the signal dropping.A lot has been written about it by others as well  so let me avoid the guilt of being boring & repetitive :)To conclude  I would strongly recommend this router & am very sure that you wont be disappointed as well !!!!

840: nice product

841: One of the best purchases through AmazonThe product is as described and the set up takes only 5-10 minutesRANGE: I live on the third floor and I get the full coverage even on floors above and belowSPEED: excellent (practically lossless)FUNCTIONS: I have tested it with wired networks and as a WiFi repeater works fineVERDICT: best buy in the price range

842: Good product

843: Very good product....

844: poor signel

845: Good

846: So far working good. Easy setup. It's only for Cable broadband with RJ45 connection type.Had 3 LAN ports.I was confused which one to buy. Lots of options were available. But seeing the reviews I changed by mind. Finally settled with Digisol.Made in India.Below are the things I am sharing for the buyers which I gathered.1. The product is 802.11n radio strength. Enough for an apartment. I am able to connect with full signal from every corner of my 1000 sqft flat.2. Has on off switch at back.3. Has light indicators.4. Single band5. Easy setup6. Less heating of wifi router even if on for long Box contents are: wifi router power cord patch LAN cable installation cd and guide.I have kosnet cable broadband with Static IP.Setup process: (without patch cable)1.

U will find a wifi connection named "Digisol". Click connect. Now the wifi is connected with ur PC.3. Open browser and type the wifi IP. Its 192.168.2.1 then Enter user name "admin"  and password as 12344. Wifi home opens.5. Click Setup. Click Manual. U have 3 optionsPPPoE  DHCP and Static IP.6. Select Static IP.7.

847: Totally worth it

848: First thing is that it's our Indian product little confused while ordering that whether it should gives the positive result or not.. it has very good wifi range working great without any hanging heating or disconnecting in my 3 storied home.. easy to setup can use as an repeater also 5 years warranty. If you really need a good range wi-fi router then go for it you will never get disappointed... So in one word.. superb..!!

849: Awesome performance

850: Best produc in wi fi

851: Excellent performance and value for money. Range is superb when kept in middle of the home it covers whole area.My home is at third floor anf I get one or two bars at ground floor. This gives you simple idea how good its range is.Takes 15seconds maximum to work after powering on.3.00 MBPS speed of downloading measured on my habdset. My broadband if of 4MBPS hence I  believe this device is working at its best on speed part.Connected 5 handset at same time on WiFi + PC.  all Worked fine.Go for it...

852: Not that great but a good router for home use. The range is decent except obstacles like closed doors and corners some signal drop at even 6-7 meters. The warranty is not lifetime (5 years) as mentioned by AMAZON it's limited lifetime (3 years) only. DIGISOL CC confirmed it. Warranty claim by AMAZON is so misleading while buying a new router.Sellers are shipping the DIGI HR_3400 VER E1 which is the latest version with 3 years warranty.The older versions like DIGI HR-3400 and VER C1 offers 5 years warranty.There could be different switches for wi-fi and WPS  but I can live with it.

853: super

854: Awesome...

855: Very Good product. Go for it !!I haven't heard much about Digisol earlier so initially I hesitated before buying this I wanted to go for D-link but reading other reviews I decided to buy this and I must say it is living up to my expectation.Pros:1. Easy to set up.2. Wireless range is great.3. Doesn't heat up much.4. It has dual 5 db antenna which provides good wireless range without any speed drop.5. It has lifetime warranty !!6. It also has many useful built-in features.  ............and many others.............Cons:Haven't found anything yet !!So I will advise others to go for it without any hesitation.

856: Check my previous review of the seller they sent me Older version of the router which is different from the picture here. The product was faulty and the connection kept dropping off and finally there was no internet on Wifi at all. several restarts and still nothing happend. so tried resetting the router and it went kaput and died al to-gether. now not even the router's page on 192.168.2.1 is on opening on wired connection. So i was basically stuck with a dead piece of junk and was about throw it in the bin. The router says made in India If this is the quality of stuff made in India then God help us. Much better i guess is cheap made in china stuff which atleast works for some time.But amazon was perfect 5 stars for Amazon. They went over and beyond their call of duty and initiated a refund on the item even before it got picked up from me. Superb amazon. but cheat indian sellers and manufacturers.

857: Decent range. Build quality is good. Setup was easy. Firmware loads faster i.e router is almost ready as soon as it is powered on. But you may have to note one thing regarding the warranty. Even though the manufacturer says it has life time warranty I don't know if I will get it as I bought it from Amazon. Also when I tried to register the product online I got the reply saying "We will get back to you" but have not got any reply yet. Never mind.

858: Bought this router in June 2015. I was in total confusion to purchase a wifi router for the broadband cable connection i had. After going through several reviews and research over net decided to buy this. The reason was simple first of all Its MADE IN INDIA brand and economical compared to other famous brands. Amazon.in delivery was good and the product reached well before the specified time.I just delayed to write this review coz i thought to use it first for sometime. Yes this is really a very good router. I live in a house built over 1200 sqft area. I have got signals in all corners of the house. Have never faced a signal drop or any other problem till date.I sincerely recommend this product for anyone who needs a very good wifi router for the cable broadband connection within the budget.The led lights are so powerful that you will not need a night lamp in your room.

859: so far the best router i experienced. fast n smooth. much much better than netgear. if u r using an indian ISP this is for u. unlike other routers who cannot automatically connect when connection line is repaired this one does. i am using GTPL as ISP which has many repairing issues this router saves a lot of time. in netgear i had to restart router in order to connect again. but this u plug and forget.

860: Its not at all upto the mark. The range is very bad. I am not able to get coverage upto a distance of 15 meters. I think this is the worst router i have seen.

861: not at all a good product...dont buyits range is not even 10 meter....it is totally fake product.

862: Very poor quality product. I brought the product in July 2016 and it started giving problems in Novemer 2016 and under its lifetime warranty I got the product replaced. But it has started to give trouble again now(February2017). The technical support team also is of no use.

863: Their very big bug in this router if you keep router continuously on then router signal singles get  disconnect and router automatically get restart again and again . And also there is big bug in the  firmware that when you connect you mobile devices the to pay games or watch any video from app (like jio  airtel tv  FIFA takken etc) you getting loading sign but it does get loaded this because of the firmware i thought this may be issues with my isp but when i cross check then i came to know their big issues in firmware .hence i request please do not buy this product

864: great product easy to install

865: nice productworth priceit doesn't get heat up and devices also don't disconnect.

866: Best budget router....I didn't find out any disadvantage with this router...I refer this product two of my friend and also they have very good opinion about it...

867: No heating issuesAwesome signal rangeBang for the buckJust go for it.

868: Nice and cheap go for this router .... Made in india :)

869: Product installation is so easy and I am using this product with ACT fibre net.Ideal for home usage Signal strength is excellent in entire house and also its reaching on the terrace as well.Great device in small budget.well why to spend more money when things getting done spending small amounts of money.A small cable to physically connect the router and laptop for router configuration is provided as well.So i can say that this product is designed to be more customer friendly considering all the minute details.I strongly recommend this product to everyone !!

870: very nyc product

871: Bought this gem yesterday from local shop after my 5 month old Tplink router started malfunctioning and service centre said that it will take 60 days to repair/ replace it. The difference in performance betweeen Tplink and Digisol is clearly visible. Digisol is giving much better speed and Stable connection. Read very nice reviews for Tplink modem and bought them but at the end very disapointed with Tplink product and Service.

872: This is a very well designed router with dual high gain antennae.The web management page at 192.168.2.1 gives plenty of details and parameters to fine tune.Also has a feature to upgrade firmware.Has good range better than my previous Netgear WNR614.Also has a dedicated on/off button (absent on my previous router) and WPS button.Last but not least I purchased it after reading so many positive reviews about a 'Made in India' product.And those positive reviews indeed turned out to be true.

873: They say it is made in India. The product does not work you need to turn it off and turn it back on again every day. If you tell the problem they tell you to travel to Bangalore and get a replacement there. Which is not practical. The branch managers don't know how to properly talk. Especially the Maharastra head Mr. Sanjay Tiwari he rejects your call and asks us to call later. The higher management does not have coordination. Bad customer service in total.

874: The product functions very well till it functions. It will start restating continuously 1 day around after 6 month usage and then it is pure trash. And somehow it is easily hacked. I had unknown devices connected even after changing password to a tough one. Good luck claiming warranty from a small room in a dark tower in nehru place. I never went for warranty claim. Buying tp link now

875: i dont prefer digisol routers beacuse they really work so good for 1year and slowly its performance degrades and if in case there is any damage service center people refuse to do it for free  they charge 400/- even for a minor problem  5year warranty is of no use at all  instead gop for d-link or tp-link routers

876: Its good...range is good (i have 3 bhk 1300sq ft).Its simple nd small...also service is good!Go for it ...no issues!

877: Started showing issue of frequent disconnection after working properly for 14 days. As the replacement window is over am stuck with the product.

878: The product is working great till now. No issues at all. WiFi network in my 4bhk Flat is grt. We get 5 years of warranty for this product. And the main thing it’s a MADE IN INDIA product. Go for it guys..

879: One of the worst product doesn't work sometimes speed is very very slow though having two antennas still the coverage area is very less. Better go for D-Link or Netgear

880: I am using it for more them a month. Helpline support form Digisol was smooth. Looking for an Indian Company and Digisol ended my serach. Nice look and extremely efficient and the best in class warranty. Nothing more I can ask? TrulyMake in India!

881: All d products that v hav ordered were fine xcept one. Recently i hav ordered gala spin mop bt it doesn't meet with my requirement. Its handle is not working well. It separates from its mop. I hav used it 4 jst 3 or 4 times.

882: After use of 3/4 months the router started to stop data connection automatically after even 2/3 minutes of use. Send for replacement.

883: Do not buy..after 6 month the mac id automatically change

884: Buy mi router instead of this ! They don't provide any firmware updates ! 2018 oudated !!

885: The super fantastic router in this rangeI have four router but Digisol 3400 range is super amonge them I am living 4th floor and range is on the road how nice range.

886: worked good for few months then the connection drooped frequently everyday and even the connection was active connecting to router was impossible.

887: This router is a monster. Full power.. killer range and it can cover 900sq feet flat easily without droping single line of reception.

888: Superb Product !! Go for it without second thought ...

889: Worst experience

890: although the product delivered on time  sharp 12 hrs but delivered the wrong model !! the seller named PACIFIC INC sent me the older model with matt black top but after i opened the package i realised this matt back one is good n dust resistant !! i already own a DLINK adls2+ modem router for bsnl lines the shiney top fades away on time also no wifi on/off swich is present in this  .. so overall this MADE IN INDIA product is working flawlessly  and range is quite better in our 3bhk 1250 sqft apartment .....!!finally amazon.in amazed me every times for its so quick delivery.

891: Loved it nice onegot on lightnig  deal.....Amazon best 1 day delivery it was

901: this router is best..just best !!! just go for it... i have a very compact and closed house structure and the router is placed in my room which is on the roof...still it covers the whole house and some range beyond it...its best you're gona get in this price range...i bought it injust  1k 3 months ago... took me just five minutes for the setup...working like a charm !!

902: This digisol router has issues w r t memory leak I believe. Router stops broadcasting SSID's after couple of hours and not visible /working till reboot digisol router. I don't recommend buying this router any more It is better to buy D-link or Netgear routers for your home/small office purpose.I am really upset and planning to return this router.

903: I must say that this is a very good router I have an old dogisol single antenna router on the ground floor of my villa however I was not getting WiFi signal on my first floor rooms I have my DVR (CCTV) on the first floor however I don't want to pull a RG45 cable from down to top. So I installed this router on the first floor and used it as a repeater (wirelessly plug and play) and also connected my DVR with the small internet cable. Working fine and getting first floor signal all around and out of my villa. Strongly recommended

904: Can I use this with idea broadband

DIGISOL-DG-BG4300NU-300Mbps-Wireless-Broadband:
1: It is compact in size with nice look easy to install

Digisol-wireless-micro-adapter-DG-WN3150Nu:
1: Pros:-1. Similar price to tp-link wifi adapter.2. It's made by an Indian networking manufacturing company "DIGISOL" which will last longer than any Chinese counter part.3. Built quality is strong.4. Supports in Windows XP Viata 7 8 8.1 and 10. (I have tested in all the OS)5. Don't forget to install the wireless wlan driver from the provided CD.6. Using it for last 3 years  it's still working fine and this is my second device.Cons:-1. Range of reception quality is not strong enough more than 10 metres.2. Not sure that it supports MacOS or Linux.3. Maximum bandwidth speed shows 72.2Mbps not 150Mbps (I don't know why).Overall It's a Indian product buy it blindly without any hesitation.Hit the "helpful" button at the end.Thank You!!

2: It is the best in this price  range. The range is very good. Smooth running of internet from this. Better than many big brand items.

3: Works as given in description. I use it to create hotspots as well. speed is good. Driver installation should be downloadable from web. currently using it with a MediaTek application instead of the one provided because i dont have cd drive. :( but performance wise it's good

4: As always delivered before time by amazon.nicely packed. A very tiny usb drive less pricey but perfect one.using for more than 4 months no problem with it. it gives good connection speed no lagging or minimization speed issue.worth buy

5: The adapter gets heated very fast. The plastic cover is so tiny that it becomes difficult to insert and taking out of the USB port of the computer. Signal strength reception too is not up to the mark like other Digisol products.

6: Very good product.  Works great if you have 3g instead of 2g in your mobile to get internet from your mobile (with hotspot feature) to PC.  I wanted to have secondary net connection in my PC through my mobile when my broadband gets disconnected and this Digisol USB adapter does it effortlessly.P.S.: There was some tampering with the price in the packet.  Do compare before buying.

7: Its range is awsome & it can catch upto 4 mbps speed. I inspired from this product which is used in our office and now I have purchased for my home also. In one ward it is cheap and best.

8: Waste of money.Windows7 : it disconnects frequently.GNU/Linux: did not work at all.

9: You need to disconnect and connect it again as it resets once the computer is shut down or restarted..Other than that it is satisfactory and does the work it has been bought to do so.

10: stopped working after an year.Was okay. Not bad.  Some disconnections once in a while.this week it stopped working completely. Had to get another one (not this)

85: Good

86: excellent product

87: Very good product.

88: very good

89: No issue with it

90: I loved the item and I'm able to use it very easily.It took less than 5 minutes to install it and go. I would suggest to all who look for going with less expense and good quality.

91: Decent stuff packed into a compact space. Works just right and neat for a home / office setup for a range of 12 meters (upto one wall as obstruction). Overall  - good value for money.

92: This is just wifi dingle and not bluetooth enabled. Someone replied me saying bluetooth headphone can be connected but we can not connect bluetooth headphone using this. It identifies only wifi signals and not BT signal. Similarly smartphone bluetooth does not discover it. If we start hotspot on phone then phone is discoverable by computer via this device. So basically it can be used for internet sharing and not audio sharing..

93: It didn't connect to the Home Wifi immediately and I needed to call the Support call center and get help. After a couple of reboots it finally connected but with a weaker connection in comparison to my other devices.

94: This do not work on linux platform...facing difficulty configuring on Linux. Working with windows is perfect. Signal reception is awesome.

95: This my second one i already bought and i used it for three years with no problems with that confident i got another one.Pros:covers longer distance.comes with 5 years of warranty which other brands cannot provideEasy installation procedure.

96: Not working. I am not able to connect my phone's wifi to my pc's wifi using this adapter. I have used mHotspot and other methods to make my pc in to a wifi hot spot but all in vein. I am using windows 7 and latest android version in my phone. Return policy is should be more that 15 day or 30 days.

97: The signal receiving power is very poor

98: Nice incredible design and easy to use and signal is coming to almost 30ft with wall in between. You can turn it to wifi router also.

99: it works for linux i tested the device in ubuntu 14.04 ubuntu 16.04  the drivers loaded automatically no extra effort/installation required for linux. tested on three different computers/PC it works perfectly (both on intel combo and amd based mother boards).

100: Great WiFi Receiver It's working since 2016-Feb Still no issues.

101: Problem in first time installation and connection then zooooooom

102: very good wifi receiver..but problem is it does not have range more then 50feets..otherwise its ok...

103: Horrible range and stability!Keeps getting disconnected!!!!

104: Using it on my raspberry pi 2. Doesnt work.

105: Cute and good

106: IT is working perfectly with out any problem

107: Is it compatible with win8.1?

108: I LIKE THIS ITEM VERY GOOD.

109: Is not working in Windows8. OS crashes with blue screen and restarts :-(. Not able to get this working

Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-802-11N-Wireless-Broadband:
1: I have used several ADSL routers over past 12 years but this one from digisol is best of them. My location is about 3 kms from the BSNL exchange and earlier connection dropouts were common especially in summers and rainy season. But after installing this router that problem is now almost gone. In addition to that this router offers far more functionality than what BSNL issued modems provide.

2: The white color was not available as shown in photo but the seller immediately called me as soon as I ordered this to ask if it's okay to send black color instead.The packaging and all was very neat and good.Now let's come to main pointThe durability - the modem is very durable and small so m happy with itRange - the range of this wi fi is similar to any other modem at this range but what makes it different is it's strength signal. It's full even from 3 room next to it.Made in India - that's what I liked the most. If something is made in India n worthy of it I always buy itObviously there are cons too for example the reset button I doubt it u can press it with hand n side power button looks like made of some cheap plastic quality but I definitely suggest this to anyone looking for modem n router at this price range cuz no problems on my end 👍

3: One of the best modems that I ever Purchased. Before purchasing this I had DLink Asusbut didnt get this type of performance. Very easy to Install. Now Iam having fast Internet connection and using BSNL bradbandThanks to Digisol IndiaProud to say thatIts an Indian product

4: A compact & sturdy ADSL2+ modem & router.Based on the newer N series with 300 Mbps network speed.Suports 3G dongles too.Carries 3 year warranty.Been using it with  my bsnl connection via landline.Has two 5db gain antennas for better & strong connection.

5: Configuring it took some time. The logo on the product still looks suspicious about the originality of the item. Though it is working fine.Even the web portal look different when connected through 192.168.1.1

6: So Far So Good with BSNL ADSL BB connection which is 10mbps speed. It has been week this modem has been setup. And the coverage of WiFi is pretty good also there is no connection drop issue. The modem interface is designed with web based UI and we have more options compared with other modem. Pretty good  modem made in INDIA.

7: I bought this on june 2018 and writing it on jan 2019. I think it is a good product for me. I bought this for ₹1350/-. No any issue felt but I didn't felt any serious advantage of having the second antenna ie; I can't feel any serious boost of the wifi network in my house with the two antenna while comparing with my previous one antenna modem. Maybe it is due to wifi traveling issue in my house (have lots of walls). But like i said i didn't feel any loss of speed even though the signal strength are low. Also our devices must be capable to grab the signal very well

8: First time ever I am really dissatisfied with the packaging of Amazon India. The box as shown in the picture is damaged. This box was just inside a Plastic Packet and no separate carton box was given by the seller in this case to protect the original device box. Amazon insists on providing original covers tags etc while accepting a return but they should look into this lackadaisical approach of packaging by the seller.Coming to the device it works justs brilliantly with my BSNL ADSL Line. Setting it up was a breeze and it provides good speed and coverage with its two antennas. I am receiving pretty decent coverage on my first floor room as well as through out the house with the device placed at a corner room in my house.The box consists of Router device Power adapter a splitter for adsl line and telephone Short RJ45 cable two telephone cables for connecting the device.It also has a quick start guide a installer cd with step by step instructions on how to install the device properly.Just go for ityou will not repent buying this device.

9: The router is easy to set up and manage. Has three options for internet connection - ADSL RJ45 and USB dongle support. I am using it with USB dongle at the moment and it is good for the purpose.But it does have one issue. It frequently redirects to Tata Docomo wired broadband site. At first I thought the issue is with my computer but no it happens on all my devices all the phones and even my friends' laptops when browsing through this router. It is very annoying at times.

10: I was not sure whether to buy this relatively unknown brand or spend a few thousand bucks more and go for more popular manufacturers but I took a chance looking at positive reviews it got and man I'm glad that I did. The product is amazing and the price is a steal. I have been using it for several months now and no complaint till date. The coverage is really good.

11: I my writing this review after years of utilization of this modem.Easy to install and high capacity and log distance frequency. Range almost first floor to third floor. Go with it...

12: really awesome product and customer service is 2 good. i am use connect with dongle.

13: Has been giving me problems from day one. The BSNL says the modem has a problem. Once a while the internet comes on for about 1 or 2 minutes and then dies off. The window for returns has already expired. Hope amazon does something about this.

14: Very delicate nice colourgood coverage & speed as well Awesome adsl modem+ router.And most importantly indigenous product in this range with usb port double antennas. Happy with digisol product.Thanks to Amazon services very fast & reliable.Birhade Sanjay Harishchandra Nashik Maharashtra India.

15: Product made in India. Good one as per price.Range is good.At 12 m After crossing two walls It provides signal.24 x 7 running with normal heating. Easy installation.

16: Good design but rather limited range into even next room compared to my earlier TP-Link 150 MBPS single antenna router. But sets up quite easily.

17: Great product. Had to go online to customer service for installation procedure and they were very helpful. Working faultlessly and I have to commend the customer service of Digisol for guiding me through every step of the installation process.

18: Best product for home use...Pros :-> Indian Product-> Customer service is really good-> No Heating or disconnection problem [normally it ll be switched on 24-48 hrs continuously]-> Best value buy for moneyCons :-> 2 layers walls = Low signal coverage

19: product is good and made in India. If you want to convert  usb printer to wifi you need to buy TP link TD W 8968 to achieve this

20: After more than one month review.. Kept on unless there is any power outage..Working well with good speed and range.. Definetely recommended for home.

21: @1240 it is a good buy. It works well and without any problem. Range is also fine. Cover all the three floors.

22: One of the few quality modems available in market for less price and its indian gives excellent range and connectivity

23: The item was well packed and delivered on time. Installation was fairly easy. The range is quite good and so are the speeds. Provides full strength connection to all parts of my 2BHK flat.

24: Before using this I borrowed a TPLINK 300N ADSL2+ router from my friend. I was getting full coverage in my home. I am not getting similar coverage with Digisol. However This is more stable compared to TPLINK.

25: Very Good product easy set up  versatile for all purpose

26: Excellent product and super fast delivery by Amazon. Been using 24x7 for over a year now flawlessly.

27: I was satisfied with the purchaseThis product is perfectly alrightReceived it in timeThank you

28: Nice product go for it

29: good wifi range un wanted redirects  usb useless

30: GREAT PRODUCT.NICELY  WORKING .SELLER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING. WIFI RANGE IS NICE.

31: It is nice one and have good range. I could get the signal almost 40 feet away on first floor through brick walls and concrete ceiling. One thing to note is that max download speed is 24 MBps from internet. 300 MBps is speed over the wifi in the local home network devices not the internet.

32: Great Routers which is like universal

33: Good product. Works well without issues. Haven't tested the backup functionality through GSM dongle but all other features are working upto expectations.

34: Very nice product  efficient for BSNL BROADBAND

36: Working well set up was easy.

56: it is cheap and there no such area coverage

57: Faulty product .stopped working after 3 months.

58: On very initial usage device was getting heat after few days it is fine now. Writing this review so that if there is any issue at manufacturer level... they can fix that. Otherwise device is fine from most of the aspects now

59: Good product with good WiFi range

60: I'm using with BSNL broadband. Perfect good Wi-Fi coverage good looking. No cons I've faced till now. Recommended for buyers.

61: Very poor. Not good for BSNL home broadband. disconnecting every 3-5minutes.

62: very good product packing was risky as the product may damaged may be send by keeping in a plastic box contains : splitter Rj 11cable- 2piece lan cable - 1 piece

63: The router is good but the adapter looks really cheap and burnt just after 2 hours I plugged. I called the shipping agency but couldn't get their call.

64: Easy setup good build quality nice product

65: Excellent products

66: Good range (can access decently across 2 walls). Set up for MTNL took 2 minutes (please use the CD provided). Will reccomend

83: Too difficult to setup...

84: It's the best lowest price n extra future proof features...

85: Have been using it for 2 months only but it is good. I would have preffered a higher model of 600MB bandwidth as my room sizes are  big

86: Worth money spent.

87: Best part is the USB availability..

88: Good and cheap cartridge

89: Excellent product specifitionUser friendly n simple installation procedure.

177: I was initially disappointed with this as it seemed to be designed for internet input through telephone line (RJ11) whereas my internet connection was through RJ45 (regular lan cable). Later I read the manual which indicated that we could connect internet to the router by inserting RJ45 cable from modem into LAN1 port of router. This did not work initially. So I called the tech support and the lady there guided me systematically through all the settings and lo... it started working like a charm. Signal strength is also very good. I've got a duplex house with router on lower floor but get good signal in upper floor also. Kudos to this made in India product.

178: Surprisingly packing was not upto the mark. Is amazon saving on bubble wrap? Atleast electronic ggods should be bubble wrapped.About Router easy to install with CD. Range is good. Box contains Router CD POTS LAN & telephone cable.

179: Woks fine with BSNL ADSL; there is a WiFi enable/disable button and USB storage access via FTP. The cover says this works with 3G/4G USB dongles as well though I haven't tried it yet.

180: I just loved this router.I was facing issue with D-Link DSL-2730U router earlier. In that router only 1 smart device can use internet bandwidh at a time. E.g. If 1 smart phone is downloading/uploading a file then other devices have to wait.However Digisol router is amazing and now I can use all smart devices at a time. Fantastic superb product.

181: THE BEST PRODUCT FOR BSNL BROADBAND... 5+ stars...i purchased this router  at amazon. and nothing any problem .. even 24 X 7 day i continue used without switch off but not any single problem & range as compare to asus  d link tenda n others cant even matched with this router rangeDigisol router is very best result for BSNL broadband.keep it up Digisol.Seller & amazon  best packaging with superfast services delivery

182: Modem-cum-router doing its job fine but a little bit disappointed as the web interface doesnt provide the USB HDD support. Although here on amazon in the product description its mentioned that it supports USB dongle and Mass storage. But in real its a deception. It doesnt support mass storage. The Digisol customer support ate up all my time in setting this up else i would have returned it and checked for some other router. Be aware!

183: Functuinal. Still waiting for landline

184: The product is good and I am using USB 4G dongle to it that works well. I have tested with BSNL and IDEA connection and I have seen getting above 10 Mbps.The only cons I see is the signal strength. If I go to my next room (Just 1 wall) the signal drops heavily and I hardly get 1 band signal. It has 2 antenna such weak signal is not something expected.

185: Works perfect in BSNL ADSL modem connection .Sometimes Router is redirecting to tata docomo website  not exactly sure if its browser issue or modem/router issue .

186: A solid build adsl modem+ router. Made in India gives some kind of nationalist pride😊. Using it with BSNL.Connection is steady considering my earlier TP link. WiFi strength is adequate for me.Cons could be : Age old router interface indicator lights are too small to identify distinctively. USB part seems to be weakly build as per other reviews. Yet to start using that.

187: I am using this router for a year now and must say its surprisingly great product considering its price.1. cheap and good set of features2. great support3. made in India !!!

188: I bought  digisol router DG-BG4300NU from Amazon.The product initialy ordered was received dead on arrival/not working which was returned without any hassles thanks to Amazon.in. Ordered the router againdelivered quickly and working very well using since a month.Nice ADSL router.

189: product is very good coverage is good...overall iam fully satisfied with it..

190: One of the best WiFi router I have gone throughWiFi range is good.It doesn't get heated up even after long use Installation is quick .

191: better than d link and othersmade in india

192: A very good product by digisol with good range good for wifi networks in households. If you've taken broadband connection and donot have modem . Then this is just for you.

193: A very nice product at a good price by Amazon. Delivered with in 3 days. Download and upload speed is awesome through both wired and wireless connection. Best for BSNL broadband customers. Made in India with 5 years of warranty.

194: Using for quite sometimes seamlessly -  BSNL is Internet Service Provider - .Satisfied with the quality

195: Signal strength is overall good..

196: Wanted a replacement ADSL modem for my outgoing TP-Link td-8817. Had 2 choices - another TP-Link or this. Took the risk of going with this inspite of less ratings than TP-Link. So far with its working I think I have made the best choice. A good Made in Bharat product.

197: Just a modem with everything. It's worth it.

198: Good one and fine for home use.Easy to configure.Timely delivery as well.

199: It's greatchoose - confirm - clickso simple and the product is at your doorstep.I am happy.

200: good

201: Working Perfectly

202: Simpley and Fantastic......Over all Network speed... Digisol...Is Great Product Network speed  1.61 MB/ps

203: I am very happy to have this router.Working fine

204: It is fine.

205: Good product but range is very less

206: Good product

207: The one of the best ever modem in india till now in this price segment .....

208: I m writing this review after using the device one month. This is my first Wi-Fi modem cum router. But I m fully satisfied with its performance. The device is kept in my 2nd floor drawing room of 2 BHK flat (750-800 sq fit). But there is no problem of signal anywhere in my flat. Even I can do my work from ground floor also surrounding 50 metre area. There is no heating problem at all as I m using it for almost 16 hrs per day. Obviously it's getting heated but not too much that we have to stop using the device. I m using this for BSNL Landline to Internet connection. Installation is quite easy although I had to contact with their customer care for the last step. But that's not an issue. It takes nearly 20 minutes to install. All u need is a PC with a good DVD driver. Happy Surfing....

209: Best router for BSNL USER i ever recieved...amazon service was best..delivered 6 days earlier.. i am happy about service.. digisol router range is superb.. around 20 -30 mtr...works well with BSNL no problem with connectivity...easy setup..no heat issues ..no dsl disconnectivity...thanks for digisol and amazon superb services...

210: This is really a great router/modem but the issue is that its not a great value for money. Definitely it’ll completely solve the internet purpose as the adsl cables physically aren’t  capable of transferring high speeds but even at 2500₹ you’re just getting a single 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi band and that also of 802.11n old standards supporting speeds of only 300Mbps also it only has 10/100ethernet ports instead of 10/100/1000. Whereas at the same price you can get a lot better Wi-Fi router such as this TOTO link Wi-Fi router which supports dual band Wi-Fi with the latest 802.11ac standard at 1200mbps on 5gz network and also a little better range on 2.4 GHz network when compared to the Digisol router the TOTO link even gives you free VPN connection. My final conclusions are that this router will be more than enough for the adsl2+ internet connection with great range but it is not a great “bang for the buck” router and also due to the 10/100 Ethernet port and a single band Wi-Fi t supports file transfer speeds of only 11 Megabytes per second on your local network. I personally use this router so I know it.Link for the TOTO link Wi-Fi router that I mentioned above :-https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07BCF9TFF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_TTBUBbE5CT21Y

211: internet sharing through dongle is not working not able to share or connect internet...internet connectivity through usb is an issue

212: This DIGISOL adsl2+ router is simply awesome I must say. It works like a charm with my BSNL landline broadband. Wifi range is also awesome and it covers my 3 bed room house. The only issue is with the RJ11 cable that the company has provided. Its too short compared to rest of other routers from companies.

213: Good router by Digisol no heating problem WiFi range is good and one can also use 3g/4g dongle to share internet through USB port.

214: it is one of the third class product. guys don't buy it. even I suggest don't buy any product from amazon also.after sales support is worst. faulty product received.

215: Bought it from Croma store 2 months ago. I used 3 TP Links router in last 7 years. This is the best of them. It has better singal strength than TP Link. The best thing is that It provides stable connection.

216: Serves the purpose. Supports both LAN and DSL as input. Customer service is also very prompt

217: Using this modem as router for ACT broadband. Good signal range. Previously used this modem for Tata docomo phone line connection. Best product. Just go for it.

218: Can  this router supports  4g  data card ?

219: I did not get the same product as shown but...it had all d specifications as mentioned so no problem ....with that.  ...it. Has a vv good range .....it crossses 2 walls of my house and still has a good range..... does not heat at all....setup may cause some trouble.......but is manageable.... So I would definitely recommend dis product... For those who need a good range....!!

220: I bought this router couple of years ago ...... and its still working excellent without any hiccupsIts a beautiful router by looks  and works equally well.The range is also good ....around 1600sqft.The signal strength is also good .thanks to those 2×5dbi antennas.There is a facility to connect mass storage too.It is quite easy to setup.Dosent heat up.I would suggest u to go for it ... researched a lot and i think its the the best router at this price.

221: just buy it ..no questions

222: this is very good. i give u 5 points

223: It doesn't  support WAN .As maximum internet service provider gives WAN service.

224: Where is the wps botton

225: I want to purchase a wifi router cum range extender for my mts wifi dongle.. What should I buy for that??

226: how to connect a range extender there is no button behind it

227: Very poor signal strength not recommended

Digisol-DG-HR3400-Wireless-Broadband-Router:
1: I lived in Kolkata as Paying guest. My upper floor uses TP LINK and ground floor has a d link router but compared with two router my router signal is strong. I hope smartlink will keep the same product quality.

2: The power supply was loose and as a result the router would either restart frequently or not start at all. Problem appeared a few months after purchase.

3: Amazing made in India product and value for money too. Network strength is good even if the doors are closed in a 2 BHK flat.Would definitely recommend all to go for it. No need of going for any made in China product.

4: This router is worst of its kind.It frequently disconnects from connected devices and you have to restart the router again and again to get connection.

5: Good product like range is very good but hanging regularly and adaptor dead frequently and on/off switch problems. If these problem fix it is No.1 products.

6: Very  good product. I got it at a comparatively low price on amazon.using it from 1 Year.pros: long range connection Upto 20 Metre  radius.high speed 7-8 Mbps.double antennae for good coverage.3 Years warranty.no problem till date.  Cons:  no problems.

7: Did quite some research. Amazon does not hide reviews. Delivered as order and great price. Great experience. Digisol is made in India that is why I chose it plus all positive reviews. Installation guide was so lengthy. Simple installation was load the driver. Create a network from my networks on the PC. And thats all. ... Thank you Amazon and the reviewers.

57: Good product from Digisol its a wide range of signal strength with 30-40 mts.

58: Champion in speed and range. I have tried several tp link routers to cover my 2bhk house. Signal was week in deep corners and ends of the house. Finally tried digisol Wonderful product. Now I am getting full signal strength all over the house and surprising thing is it covers  few more meters outside the house. While we are using 2 phones 1 tab and laptop speed is not dropping at all. Dont think go for it. Installation is also simple.

59: Not as good as I thoughtafter 1 year it had problems of net connection Auto restart Phone connection lost wireless range got down.I have to restart it approx 20-25 times in a day.

60: Product was not as shown in image. I guess change in looks from company. Everything else is great the product is compact plus dual antenna covers broader range. Overall it's a good product I would recommend it to a friend.

63: good product. i can used it at 30mtr distance .

70: A good product

71: Good one

72: This router is good for usage on mobile and tablets even on laptops for emails and browsing. Also good for streaming content through firetv. But fails miserably when using business application like Skype for business. If you are on call with screenshare then god saves u. This router has less ram and not enough processor power so once network load increase throughout flactuates between 100mbps to 160 but never reach 300. Had to reboot several times. Got it replaced once but no luck my Tplink 841N is always better. Dont buy this router HR3400 instead buy Tplink 841 which has broadcom chip and stable reliable further is cheaper than this model.

73: Awsome product..i purchs 1 yr ago from amazon..guys product is just awsome..i hv 3 floor house..my and nearby 2house  also connect my router signl..routr signl is too strong...if u use brodband 512 kbps or up...guys purchs this product.digisol rocks.

74: Well I bought the digisol router 300mbps just yesterday and got it fixed. The area of wifi coverage does not match to what mentioned. Covers less than 200. Very average performance. Not liking it. Getting out returned.Ajay

75: Great one...Best in class.Covers a wide area..covers upto 100..I bought it in March...now also it is working fine.The installation is very much easier than anything!! I suggest this one.

76: It's an amazing product. I had my own doubts before I purchased this but so many positive reviews here on Amazon have compelled me to go for it. Was using a Belkin router 150 MBPS but honestly I never experienced the speed and the range that I experienced on this. My ISP is Act Corp Internet(Beam Tele) at 40 MBPS speed. I was completely dumbstruck at the speed I was getting on Digisol. All the apps on my mobile and the tablet are opening in fractions of seconds which is at least 4-5 times faster than my old router. Coming to the range none of the phones in the last few years have caught the wifi signal in my bedroom where the signals from the router has to pass through two heavy walls. I always had to come out of the room or switch on to 3G/4G to browse in my room. But after installing this router I'm getting the wifi signals in those spots of the room where I never got any in all these years and that too with amazing speeds. In fact I was really surprised if this is what the speed is. This router is a perfect justice for the 40 MBPS Interet unlike my old one. Thanks for all the positive reviews on Amazon that helped me making my decision.

77: Bakvass product i buy this router in march 2k16.Not working properly. No service center near me n custmer care no not ans my que worst compny i eve seen so dont buy this router.

Even modem is a bit small in size & by look its simple cool. I highly prefer to buy it. Even it does not have heating problem.

85: Beautiful product......

19: Best Product

20: its good product

21: Good product

22: Good product

23: 18-10-2017: Got it for 399/-.  Yet to use because the CD provided is not readable by my Win-7 Desktop.  (Order: 07-10-17 Del: 10-10-17)19-10-17:  Somehow managed to get installed.  Tested for one hour found to be very good. Quality product from well known brand (Digisol-Poor customer service. Observed from their Toll Free number).26-10-17:  Superb working smoothly no heating no hanging.08-12-2017: My review dt. 26-10-17 is continuing......Amazon delivery to my destination is just fair almost a day is wasted at their ChennaI Hub  according to my observationf from 4 recent purchases.

24: The pack comes with an empty installation disk. I made the device act as a wi-fi hotspot but when I select this the internet works on my other device through wi-fi but internet doesn't work on the host device i.e. pc. itself. The customer support of Digisol sucks.

25: Range is very bad. It doesn't work well in a 500 Sq.ft Rooms. My router is in one room my desktop with Digisol Wireless is in the other. And speed is reduced by almost 50% with doors closed. With doors open speed reduced by 75%.- Keep your room doors open. Adjust your desktop closer to the main router. This helps.- I found it useful as it gets my work done with somewhat slower speeds. I get 20Mbps. My phones gets a speed of 20Mbps even when i stand outside my gate. But This Digisol wireless is in the next room and I get 12 Mbps with doors opened and around 7 mbps with doors closed. So it doesn't/cannot capture the full 20mbps speed.But I guess I can't complain much because its worth the money. If I had to buy a 'good' Wireless Card for my Desktop it would have cost me around 900-1300 bucks.As i read many comments they tell it doesn't work well. It works very well with windows 7 & 10. Didn't try with 8 and 8.1.

26: amazing product

27: I was not given with the exact product what they have shown in the image which  is a b1 version. But I got a c1 version of this product .anyway it is working fine but  sometimes failed to Recognise the wi-fi signal even which is very close to this product .

28: Good

29: Good Product.

30: My purpose is fullfilled. I am able to connect my desktop with router. streaming is good.

31: best quality

32: Very nice

33: Nice One

34: works perfectly.

35: THANKS

36: Product is really working fabulous as expected. Working perfectly on Windows 10 there is no need to install device drivers windows automatically installed it when you plug is first time. And of course very good response when u hit any website or even downloading something. Thanks and credit goes to Digisol.

37: Very Nice Product. Good Quality

38: Does it work with hp 1005m printer for printing

39: This is a N300 adapter so it works the best with an n300 mbps wifi router.I have tried connecting this with both n150 & n300 mbps wifi router with the n150 mbps router this device connects & disconnects frequently causing extreme rage. It was working fine with n300 mbps wifi router.Packaging was as usual flawless.

40: Not satisfied with this ...Not work.

Digisol-DG-BG4300NU-Wireless-Broadband-Router:
1: I have used several ADSL routers over past 12 years but this one from digisol is best of them. My location is about 3 kms from the BSNL exchange and earlier connection dropouts were common especially in summers and rainy season. But after installing this router that problem is now almost gone. In addition to that this router offers far more functionality than what BSNL issued modems provide.

2: The white color was not available as shown in photo but the seller immediately called me as soon as I ordered this to ask if it's okay to send black color instead.The packaging and all was very neat and good.Now let's come to main pointThe durability - the modem is very durable and small so m happy with itRange - the range of this wi fi is similar to any other modem at this range but what makes it different is it's strength signal. It's full even from 3 room next to it.Made in India - that's what I liked the most. If something is made in India n worthy of it I always buy itObviously there are cons too for example the reset button I doubt it u can press it with hand n side power button looks like made of some cheap plastic quality but I definitely suggest this to anyone looking for modem n router at this price range cuz no problems on my end 👍

3: One of the best modems that I ever Purchased. Before purchasing this I had DLink Asusbut didnt get this type of performance. Very easy to Install. Now Iam having fast Internet connection and using BSNL bradbandThanks to Digisol IndiaProud to say thatIts an Indian product

4: A compact & sturdy ADSL2+ modem & router.Based on the newer N series with 300 Mbps network speed.Suports 3G dongles too.Carries 3 year warranty.Been using it with  my bsnl connection via landline.Has two 5db gain antennas for better & strong connection.

5: Configuring it took some time. The logo on the product still looks suspicious about the originality of the item. Though it is working fine.Even the web portal look different when connected through 192.168.1.1

6: So Far So Good with BSNL ADSL BB connection which is 10mbps speed. It has been week this modem has been setup. And the coverage of WiFi is pretty good also there is no connection drop issue. The modem interface is designed with web based UI and we have more options compared with other modem. Pretty good  modem made in INDIA.

7: I bought this on june 2018 and writing it on jan 2019. I think it is a good product for me. I bought this for ₹1350/-. No any issue felt but I didn't felt any serious advantage of having the second antenna ie; I can't feel any serious boost of the wifi network in my house with the two antenna while comparing with my previous one antenna modem. Maybe it is due to wifi traveling issue in my house (have lots of walls). But like i said i didn't feel any loss of speed even though the signal strength are low. Also our devices must be capable to grab the signal very well

8: First time ever I am really dissatisfied with the packaging of Amazon India. The box as shown in the picture is damaged. This box was just inside a Plastic Packet and no separate carton box was given by the seller in this case to protect the original device box. Amazon insists on providing original covers tags etc while accepting a return but they should look into this lackadaisical approach of packaging by the seller.Coming to the device it works justs brilliantly with my BSNL ADSL Line. Setting it up was a breeze and it provides good speed and coverage with its two antennas. I am receiving pretty decent coverage on my first floor room as well as through out the house with the device placed at a corner room in my house.The box consists of Router device Power adapter a splitter for adsl line and telephone Short RJ45 cable two telephone cables for connecting the device.It also has a quick start guide a installer cd with step by step instructions on how to install the device properly.Just go for ityou will not repent buying this device.

9: The router is easy to set up and manage. Has three options for internet connection - ADSL RJ45 and USB dongle support. I am using it with USB dongle at the moment and it is good for the purpose.But it does have one issue. It frequently redirects to Tata Docomo wired broadband site. At first I thought the issue is with my computer but no it happens on all my devices all the phones and even my friends' laptops when browsing through this router. It is very annoying at times.

10: I was not sure whether to buy this relatively unknown brand or spend a few thousand bucks more and go for more popular manufacturers but I took a chance looking at positive reviews it got and man I'm glad that I did. The product is amazing and the price is a steal. I have been using it for several months now and no complaint till date. The coverage is really good.

11: I my writing this review after years of utilization of this modem.Easy to install and high capacity and log distance frequency. Range almost first floor to third floor. Go with it...

12: really awesome product and customer service is 2 good. i am use connect with dongle.

13: Has been giving me problems from day one. The BSNL says the modem has a problem. Once a while the internet comes on for about 1 or 2 minutes and then dies off. The window for returns has already expired. Hope amazon does something about this.

14: Very delicate nice colourgood coverage & speed as well Awesome adsl modem+ router.And most importantly indigenous product in this range with usb port double antennas. Happy with digisol product.Thanks to Amazon services very fast & reliable.Birhade Sanjay Harishchandra Nashik Maharashtra India.

15: Product made in India. Good one as per price.Range is good.At 12 m After crossing two walls It provides signal.24 x 7 running with normal heating. Easy installation.

16: Good design but rather limited range into even next room compared to my earlier TP-Link 150 MBPS single antenna router. But sets up quite easily.

17: Great product. Had to go online to customer service for installation procedure and they were very helpful. Working faultlessly and I have to commend the customer service of Digisol for guiding me through every step of the installation process.

18: Best product for home use...Pros :-> Indian Product-> Customer service is really good-> No Heating or disconnection problem [normally it ll be switched on 24-48 hrs continuously]-> Best value buy for moneyCons :-> 2 layers walls = Low signal coverage

19: product is good and made in India. If you want to convert  usb printer to wifi you need to buy TP link TD W 8968 to achieve this

20: After more than one month review.. Kept on unless there is any power outage..Working well with good speed and range.. Definetely recommended for home.

21: @1240 it is a good buy. It works well and without any problem. Range is also fine. Cover all the three floors.

22: One of the few quality modems available in market for less price and its indian gives excellent range and connectivity

23: The item was well packed and delivered on time. Installation was fairly easy. The range is quite good and so are the speeds. Provides full strength connection to all parts of my 2BHK flat.

24: Before using this I borrowed a TPLINK 300N ADSL2+ router from my friend. I was getting full coverage in my home. I am not getting similar coverage with Digisol. However This is more stable compared to TPLINK.

25: Very Good product easy set up  versatile for all purpose

26: Excellent product and super fast delivery by Amazon. Been using 24x7 for over a year now flawlessly.

30: GREAT PRODUCT.NICELY  WORKING .SELLER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING. WIFI RANGE IS NICE.

31: It is nice one and have good range. I could get the signal almost 40 feet away on first floor through brick walls and concrete ceiling. One thing to note is that max download speed is 24 MBps from internet. 300 MBps is speed over the wifi in the local home network devices not the internet.

83: Too difficult to setup...

84: It's the best lowest price n extra future proof features...

85: Have been using it for 2 months only but it is good. I would have preffered a higher model of 600MB bandwidth as my room sizes are  big

86: Worth money spent.

87: Best part is the USB availability..

88: Good and cheap cartridge

89: Excellent product specifitionUser friendly n simple installation procedure.

174: I am very satisfied

175: Fair

176: Good product.

177: I was initially disappointed with this as it seemed to be designed for internet input through telephone line (RJ11) whereas my internet connection was through RJ45 (regular lan cable). Later I read the manual which indicated that we could connect internet to the router by inserting RJ45 cable from modem into LAN1 port of router. This did not work initially. So I called the tech support and the lady there guided me systematically through all the settings and lo... it started working like a charm. Signal strength is also very good. I've got a duplex house with router on lower floor but get good signal in upper floor also. Kudos to this made in India product.

178: Surprisingly packing was not upto the mark. Is amazon saving on bubble wrap? Atleast electronic ggods should be bubble wrapped.About Router easy to install with CD. Range is good. Box contains Router CD POTS LAN & telephone cable.

179: Woks fine with BSNL ADSL; there is a WiFi enable/disable button and USB storage access via FTP. The cover says this works with 3G/4G USB dongles as well though I haven't tried it yet.

180: I just loved this router.I was facing issue with D-Link DSL-2730U router earlier. In that router only 1 smart device can use internet bandwidh at a time. E.g. If 1 smart phone is downloading/uploading a file then other devices have to wait.However Digisol router is amazing and now I can use all smart devices at a time. Fantastic superb product.

181: THE BEST PRODUCT FOR BSNL BROADBAND... 5+ stars...i purchased this router  at amazon. and nothing any problem .. even 24 X 7 day i continue used without switch off but not any single problem & range as compare to asus  d link tenda n others cant even matched with this router rangeDigisol router is very best result for BSNL broadband.keep it up Digisol.Seller & amazon  best packaging with superfast services delivery

182: Modem-cum-router doing its job fine but a little bit disappointed as the web interface doesnt provide the USB HDD support. Although here on amazon in the product description its mentioned that it supports USB dongle and Mass storage. But in real its a deception. It doesnt support mass storage. The Digisol customer support ate up all my time in setting this up else i would have returned it and checked for some other router. Be aware!

183: Functuinal. Still waiting for landline

184: The product is good and I am using USB 4G dongle to it that works well. I have tested with BSNL and IDEA connection and I have seen getting above 10 Mbps.The only cons I see is the signal strength. If I go to my next room (Just 1 wall) the signal drops heavily and I hardly get 1 band signal. It has 2 antenna such weak signal is not something expected.

185: Works perfect in BSNL ADSL modem connection .Sometimes Router is redirecting to tata docomo website  not exactly sure if its browser issue or modem/router issue .

186: A solid build adsl modem+ router. Made in India gives some kind of nationalist pride😊. Using it with BSNL.Connection is steady considering my earlier TP link. WiFi strength is adequate for me.Cons could be : Age old router interface indicator lights are too small to identify distinctively. USB part seems to be weakly build as per other reviews. Yet to start using that.

187: I am using this router for a year now and must say its surprisingly great product considering its price.1. cheap and good set of features2. great support3. made in India !!!

188: I bought  digisol router DG-BG4300NU from Amazon.The product initialy ordered was received dead on arrival/not working which was returned without any hassles thanks to Amazon.in. Ordered the router againdelivered quickly and working very well using since a month.Nice ADSL router.

189: product is very good coverage is good...overall iam fully satisfied with it..

190: One of the best WiFi router I have gone throughWiFi range is good.It doesn't get heated up even after long use Installation is quick .

191: better than d link and othersmade in india

192: A very good product by digisol with good range good for wifi networks in households. If you've taken broadband connection and donot have modem . Then this is just for you.

193: A very nice product at a good price by Amazon. Delivered with in 3 days. Download and upload speed is awesome through both wired and wireless connection. Best for BSNL broadband customers. Made in India with 5 years of warranty.

194: Using for quite sometimes seamlessly -  BSNL is Internet Service Provider - .Satisfied with the quality

195: Signal strength is overall good..

196: Wanted a replacement ADSL modem for my outgoing TP-Link td-8817. Had 2 choices - another TP-Link or this. Took the risk of going with this inspite of less ratings than TP-Link. So far with its working I think I have made the best choice. A good Made in Bharat product.

197: Just a modem with everything. It's worth it.

198: Good one and fine for home use.Easy to configure.Timely delivery as well.

199: It's greatchoose - confirm - clickso simple and the product is at your doorstep.I am happy.

200: good

201: Working Perfectly

203: I am very happy to have this router.Working fine

204: It is fine.

205: Good product but range is very less

206: Good product

207: The one of the best ever modem in india till now in this price segment .....

208: I m writing this review after using the device one month. This is my first Wi-Fi modem cum router. But I m fully satisfied with its performance. The device is kept in my 2nd floor drawing room of 2 BHK flat (750-800 sq fit). But there is no problem of signal anywhere in my flat. Even I can do my work from ground floor also surrounding 50 metre area. There is no heating problem at all as I m using it for almost 16 hrs per day. Obviously it's getting heated but not too much that we have to stop using the device. I m using this for BSNL Landline to Internet connection. Installation is quite easy although I had to contact with their customer care for the last step. But that's not an issue. It takes nearly 20 minutes to install. All u need is a PC with a good DVD driver. Happy Surfing....

209: Best router for BSNL USER i ever recieved...amazon service was best..delivered 6 days earlier.. i am happy about service.. digisol router range is superb.. around 20 -30 mtr...works well with BSNL no problem with connectivity...easy setup..no heat issues ..no dsl disconnectivity...thanks for digisol and amazon superb services...

210: This is really a great router/modem but the issue is that its not a great value for money. Definitely it’ll completely solve the internet purpose as the adsl cables physically aren’t  capable of transferring high speeds but even at 2500₹ you’re just getting a single 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi band and that also of 802.11n old standards supporting speeds of only 300Mbps also it only has 10/100ethernet ports instead of 10/100/1000. Whereas at the same price you can get a lot better Wi-Fi router such as this TOTO link Wi-Fi router which supports dual band Wi-Fi with the latest 802.11ac standard at 1200mbps on 5gz network and also a little better range on 2.4 GHz network when compared to the Digisol router the TOTO link even gives you free VPN connection. My final conclusions are that this router will be more than enough for the adsl2+ internet connection with great range but it is not a great “bang for the buck” router and also due to the 10/100 Ethernet port and a single band Wi-Fi t supports file transfer speeds of only 11 Megabytes per second on your local network. I personally use this router so I know it.Link for the TOTO link Wi-Fi router that I mentioned above :-https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07BCF9TFF/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_TTBUBbE5CT21Y

211: internet sharing through dongle is not working not able to share or connect internet...internet connectivity through usb is an issue

212: This DIGISOL adsl2+ router is simply awesome I must say. It works like a charm with my BSNL landline broadband. Wifi range is also awesome and it covers my 3 bed room house. The only issue is with the RJ11 cable that the company has provided. Its too short compared to rest of other routers from companies.

213: Good router by Digisol no heating problem WiFi range is good and one can also use 3g/4g dongle to share internet through USB port.

214: it is one of the third class product. guys don't buy it. even I suggest don't buy any product from amazon also.after sales support is worst. faulty product received.

215: Bought it from Croma store 2 months ago. I used 3 TP Links router in last 7 years. This is the best of them. It has better singal strength than TP Link. The best thing is that It provides stable connection.

216: Serves the purpose. Supports both LAN and DSL as input. Customer service is also very prompt

217: Using this modem as router for ACT broadband. Good signal range. Previously used this modem for Tata docomo phone line connection. Best product. Just go for it.

218: Can  this router supports  4g  data card ?

219: I did not get the same product as shown but...it had all d specifications as mentioned so no problem ....with that.  ...it. Has a vv good range .....it crossses 2 walls of my house and still has a good range..... does not heat at all....setup may cause some trouble.......but is manageable.... So I would definitely recommend dis product... For those who need a good range....!!

220: I bought this router couple of years ago ...... and its still working excellent without any hiccupsIts a beautiful router by looks  and works equally well.The range is also good ....around 1600sqft.The signal strength is also good .thanks to those 2×5dbi antennas.There is a facility to connect mass storage too.It is quite easy to setup.Dosent heat up.I would suggest u to go for it ... researched a lot and i think its the the best router at this price.

221: just buy it ..no questions

222: this is very good. i give u 5 points

223: It doesn't  support WAN .As maximum internet service provider gives WAN service.

224: Where is the wps botton

225: I want to purchase a wifi router cum range extender for my mts wifi dongle.. What should I buy for that??

226: how to connect a range extender there is no button behind it

227: Very poor signal strength not recommended

Digisol-DG-HR1020S-150Mbps-Wireless-Broadband:
1: Works for 3G. Bit slow sometimes. Take care with dongle. Drops and poor handling can easily damage hardware. Technical repair is a hassle if this happens. I prefer to plug dongle direct to laptop rather than mains.

2: takes time to connect.sometimes has issues to make a successful connection so you need to go to the admin panel through your browser and check the signal status. Works fine most of the time even the wifi speeds that it provides are decent.

3: Not working after 6 months then I contacted services center and make repairs at free of cost

4: Not recommend

5: I have ordered this product for my hubi when sim is inserted it is not receiving signal only connected its not opening google or anything i may return if this is not resolved

6: west product

7: Nice product

8: working without any problem.

9: Good product

10: Awesome it's very good.

11: Good

12: Useful for users like me. Who wants to have internet access to multiple devices. And with power adapter also we can access the internet. Only thing issometimes internet connection is getting lost. But may be due to signal or network issue. But overall satisfied. Thanks to my wife for giving me this when truly needed

13: does it support in mac operating system

14: good

Digisol-DG-WR3001N-Wireless-Range-Extender:
1: This is my second device after the same one lasted for the past 3.5 yrs and finally went kaput one fine day. I wanted to upgrade and bofuht a tp link dual band extender . Unfortunately it wasn't able to pick signal. So I ordered this again. Though it's not fancy and has a single band 2.4 ghz and claims to have upto 300mbps speeds the most important feature is it's signal strength. It's able to pick signal from my router in the ground floor without line of sight and transmit it on the first floor where this is installed . This is the main reason for going for this model. Configuring was easy enough with wps on both ends.

2: I used it and I got a cd with it but no setup file.Thats the basic thing but got missed.I already have a digisol wifi router and I bought this to avoid any compatibility issues. But when I googled the setup all the videos have 2 different routers. In my case I have both as digisol. SO very confusing for me to setup this extender via LAN of my original digisol router.Need desperate help on step by step to setup this extender to my primary digisol wifi router via LAN cable.

3: Very good product. I purchased it from amazon after returning back the earlier brought tp link extender. TP Link extender did not worked even after repeated efforts. This works well even though i did not had WNS option it was quiet easy to set up about 5 min or so. It works well with the main router and serves the purpose. Also the video streaming and surfing is at a very good speed there is no drop in the speed. Very rarely there is a issue where in device gets stuck while conecting to this wifi signal with the error "Obtaining IP address". But this gets resolved after turning off the main modem and this modem and restarting both. I have removed one star for this but still its much better than other products in competetion. Overall i would recommend this product to others.RegardsSamarth

4: I have a D- Link wifi modem. This is the only repeater that gets connected and provides good networking.I've tried TP-Link as well D-Link repeaters and none of them gets connected easily. Infact i was unable to get any internet connection thru TP-Link range extenders and the D-Link repeater has a very poor interface and security.The main problem is the life of the product. i've lost 4 repeaters to malfunctioning over 2.5 years. And I'm currently waiting for a replacement from the company.

5: i got a Digisol Wireless Repeater through Amazon. It was installed yesterday by a technician from Actnet who did the job injust 10 minutes. I am now able to receive good internet connectivity in my hall as well as upstairs when I keep one windowopen. The product is simply magnificent. Earlier I was not getting connectiity in the hall due to signals being weak. But withthe Digisol Repeater I am able to work with comfort and ease and the connectiity and strength of signals is also excellent.A very good product at a very cheap price. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to everyone in a home as their WIFI routers/modemswill have a very limited range and the Digisol repeater enables connectity to a greater area exactly as advertised.Further in reply to a communication to Help desk of Digisol made yesterday night I got a nice informative  helpful reply from Digisol.This clearly shows that this is one product you can go in for without any second thought. I am happy I have bought this

6: Not very happy.have problem in connecting without repeater I used to connect with 4-5 gadgets simultaneously(I am using Digisol modem with router ) but once I connected with the repeater I find it difficult even to connect with one gadget some times and I am forced to switch off the repeater at times.

7: Have two of these extender easy to install and if one has an issue could call digisol customer services on a toll free number they will guide you. Have a huge house with stone walls and it works perfectly  able to stream videos and chat on face time Skype and whats app calls. what more can one ask for

8: does the jobeasy to extend your wifican be used as a standalone router as wellfairy priced- price has been stable over the years- around 1500Please hit helpful if this was helpful.

9: Was looking for an Indian brand... so took this.. paid more than the competitors as it is an Indian product.. but the quality is less than average... connectivity is less.. no internet connection... product material quality is also less than average... sorry to say but not worth it.... 👎🏻

10: It's a good product and has good range. Setup is very easy just have to move the toggle switch to repeater mode and open the ip 192.168.2.3 from Mobile/laptop and it will easily setup in 2-3 minutes. Great product from Digisol.

11: Well it is a good piece..But initially I had trouble in incorporating it.No proper method has been given in the attached CD/brochure.Fron You tube demo I got the ideaNow it is working fine.

12: I don't know why amazon which is the number one in online sales and most trusted site encourages such useless products. The repeater is such a useless product. First of all is is very difficult to connect the device just to find that the range is just increased to a mere few yards. Just waste of money. It is working hence couldn't be returned.

13: worst product i have ever seen we ordered material on 18th may 2017 and today is 11 sept 2017 and this product worked only for 3 months seller is giving 5 years warranty but no one is taking responsibility to change the product customers dont purchase this product at all

14: its not helping me much.. it will divide your over all speed.. if you have 4mbps line ..then it will show on 2mbps speed if you test it through speedtest ..

15: Excellent range. Easy installation. Due to internal antena no risk of damage. VFM. Go without any doubt.

16: Works really nice. Installation was easy. Sometimes it throws tantrums I switch it off and turn it on again and it works fine then. I have installed it in the middle of my room and where the modem is. Works fine till 10 steps.

17: To say that anyone can use it even folks who are not very tech savvy would be a lie. It's a decent product but setup wasn't easy for me.New laptops don't come with CD drive. Maybe the manufacturer can make setup files available online.

18: Working very well for last 3 days. Pros:1. Very small so no mess.2. Repeater role works perfectly well.3. Very easy to setup not more than 2-3 mins.Cons: None so far

19: amazing product. I am happy with it's performance

20: Bought this for 1300 on Amazon as against 1800 from a store ..delivery was very quick ...product is very easy to install using the wps option on repeater mode.

21: Have been using this product for more than 3 months now. Its an amazing device which solve all the range related problems of wifi without compromising on speed. Must buy!! Small solution for a very big problem.

22: Excellent product from a good Indian company. Manufactured in India. Highly recommended.

23: Great product. Easy to use

24: Works at times and doesn't it's disappointingGives an orange signal even when connected VIA LAN

25: Excellent product. I am happy with it. Now I get full and strong wifi signal in every corner of the house! A great relief!!

26: A good product with limited extendability as most repeaters are.Easy to install & helpful customer service.

27: Signal gets disconnected on interval of 2 -3 minutes. Thanks to Amazon who returned the product without a question.

28: Product CD came along only has PDF manual and not the setup wizard as the documentation says. Anyhow installed it using Manual steps. Working perfectly fine.

29: Just average performance.

30: Useless ProductIt is unable to extract even half speed of what my modem offersMy Previous Netgear Extender Was far more better than this oneVery Poor Firmware

79: Good product

80: Its upto my expectations

81: Good product

82: I bought this item because my router was in the bedroom and the signal was somewhat weak in other rooms after passing through many walls. It was easy enough to set up as per the supplied instructions and does what it's supposed to do ie boost the wifi signal. The only issue I have is that my phone prefers to stick with the less powerful router signal unless I manually turn off and on the wifi radio on the phone. Same goes for my Teewe device.  I feel it's a bit overpriced since routers are available for half the price but this is the cheapest repeater I could find and there aren't too many in the market. I bought it for Rs.1359.

83: I bought this to replace the earlier Digisol Repeater taken about two years ago which suddenly went 'kaput' one  fine morning.I could not locate the bill and warranty card of earlier one so could not claim its free replacement as it comes with life time warranty. So had to buy this new one.All is okay with this but find that On-Off switch is just not there in the new design which is not good and you have to remove the plugged device altogether to re-start or shut it down.

84: The installation was a bit problem esp Mac security. Now its working well range is good. At times u have to reconfigure it.WAPS configurations failed once for me.otherwise good for the price.

85: Working fine as per specifications. The reception and transmission are excellant. Totally satisfied.

86: Increases the wifi range upto great extent and does its job well.Its multi-funtionality makes it stand apart from different range extenders

87: It didn't work as I expected.

88: Sometimes we are unable to connect our phone to this product.....i switch it off and on this thing to make it work.....

89: Superb product 👍  Just install & forget... Thanks Amazon

90: excellent Product

91: good

92: Doesn't connect with my Wi-Fi

93: The repeater worked just as required without much effort

94: Best performance. Range extender works perfectly well for me on two floors without any problem now. Very simple to setup.

95: Excellent device and true saviour for lack of Wi-Fi coverage. On 24x7 since last few months and working flawlessly! Kudos!!

96: Easy Setup Signal is good Speed is good but the rate is little bit higher

97: Not really up to the mark

Digisol-DG-WN3150Nu-Wireless-Micro-Adapter:
1: Gud for home and small office use.

Digisol-DG-BR5400QAC-AC1200-Dual-Band-Wireless:
1: 5Ghz sometimes not getting detected within same room. 5Ghz band signal very weak no range outside the room where router is kept. Used my old n class router as repeater for 802.11 N band to improve signal in other rooms for 2.4Ghz band. Probably should have gone for good models/brands.update-: Only band now works at a time. to get other band to work router must be restarted. bad quality router. seems like a waste of money. should have gone for a better expensive dual band router.

2: The router has very limited range. Its 5 Ghz network cant even reach the next room. The 2 Ghz network had better range but does not cover a 1000 sq feet house. Buy this router only if you are going to place it very close to your devices.

3: Not great router. Often does not connect to internet require rebooting. Avoid.

4: Best router working good

5: Gr8 product!!!

6: No range

7: Nice

8: The Directional Antenna's Helped a lot placing it in the center of my house. Best for High Speed Internet from Service Providers. 5Ghz works best with my iPhone.

Digisol-DG-BA3321-3-75G-Broadband-Adapter:
1: 1) It  keeps on crashing on win 7 32 bits2)It shows weak signals but other dongles show strong..3)its speed is less  other dongles have high speeds

2: It's very helpful for me..

3: Very good product.. I am really satisfied. Thank u amazon.. But it is soft wifi supported... How can i use that facility..???

4: Waste not working hotspot..

5: Worst thing ever buyed.Wastage of money.

6: Just remember it's not a wifi Hotspot it just supports wifi adapter for Hotspot good but not up to the mark

7: Very good product.. I am really satisfied. Thank u amazon..

8: I did not get  a product what I am ordering for .

Digisol-DG-HR3300TA-Router:
1: Writing after nearly 5 months of using this router.1. Setup - Was easy & straight forward. Like almost any other router today2. Coverage - This is a bit tricky to quantify. It has nearly the same range as Cisco / Linksys E900 I was using before. But with a BIG DIFFERENCE. Once a device with Wifi-N is connected to this router the connection remains much more stable and is a notch stronger. Speed drop is much less as distance increases. We notice this on almost all devices i.e smart phones laptops etc. I can now sit at far ends of our home and comfortably work instead of having to walk towards the router if I wanted use internet. HOWEVER this may not work for older devices as a laptop with Wifi-G only still has problems connecting when distance is more will a Wifi-N device works flawlessly from the same spot. Do note this is still much better than E-900 as both Wifi-G and Wifi-N Would not connect to E-900 from such spots. With Digisol DG-HR3300TA our Wifi-N devices work anywhere around the house3. Stability - This is not top-motch. Digisol requires a restart once in a day or two. The E-900 could go for weeks before we had to power cycle. We never switch off our router so this is one aspect where Digisol is a bit weak.4. Performance - We are a gadget heavy home. And this router manages to carry the load without squeaking.Giving this router a 5 start as our Wifi-N devices work great with this and we never want to go back to E-900  (which is still in fully working condition) though this joy is a liiiiiitle offset by the Digisol requiring more frequent power cycling. Happy with this buy

2: Just OK. Looks three antennas may deliver better coverage but not so. There is no switch for WiFi on/off. There are no holes on the backside for hanging / fixing on to a wall. Just to be be used as desktop piece. Similar to all the equipment manufacturers they provide smallest possible wire length from two pin plug adapter to router for power supply. Same is the case with this router also.

3: Router range is vgood however every now &then the router locks out the ip if using more than 2 devices. Every 2 days the rrouter needs to be restarted as it suddenly stops appearing in available connections. Does anyone have a clue why it does this. This never happened b4 with my tp link router

4: I just now received this router so far its going good and it's very easy to setup the wireless network with it  rest I will let u guys know how is it after a week .well well now I am using this device for I guess 4 days and I m noticing signal drops in between Nd that's not a good sign for long runeverything is superb but in between it drops signals and I m thinking for a replacement which I will ask for maybe tomorrow otherwise the router is verygood and signal range is also very good for big houses

5: Bought this router 3-4 months ago ..so far working fine but i was under the impression that it will give better wifi coverage than my previous Netgear 150 mbps router which has just small antenna unlike this which has 3 5db antenna's thts quiet obvious isnt it .....but sad to say not much difference in terms of coverage its nothing special its just the same! so a bit disappointing but if you have a small house/flat thn this is a good buy for you its made in India too!!:) in my case i live in a bungalow so its got more area to cover fighting to pass through all the house walls.

6: Coverage was so good but Wlan have some problem.When I want to connect more than 2 devices then the wlan will disabled automatically.After then if u will restart the router then u can connect only that 2 devices.Also a big disadvantage of this router -1. wifi or wlan on/off switch is not available.2. Wps light is not available. So when u want to wps connectivity then u confuse that is it on or off..

7: This is very  awesome router in this price and also range is also very good it gives me 100meter range without any signal drop i live in 1st floorrouter is at my hall on the window side then it covers the whole 100meter range and no heating problems working fine very good product by digisol... Thanks for Amazon and digisol

8: Does job well. Very light interface and easy to install. Firmware support is not good as tplink or dlink. Is not compatible for wrt firmware. No power switch. Range is good. I got for 1200 which is deal.

9: Antenna no are more in case of count but no sense in case of signal don't thing you will get more coverage

10: Good product in this price .No any issues in performance .It's 3 antennas give good range .Good for GTPL broadband no any drop down issues.Device look nice black Matt color .

11: Good

12: Superb!

16: Avarage product

17: good product good support although i could not use it due to constrains of internet service provider

18: isme security manager ka koi installment nhi h

19: Incorrect Information

20: Not up to the mark.

21: It's just a month buying it and it is now not giving any range. It got a problem and no contact is available

39: Working well and no issue

40: Bad product

41: nice product

42: Looks like a spaceship but it's a router.. I'll wrap this review in just few lines..It does what it's supposed to do.. I've got a 150sq feet house..and it covers the entire house from front door to last and from top to bottom.. I've not seen any drops.. Its lightweight.. The only gripe I have is a lack of on off switch.. Other than that.. Its too good.. Make in India.. Grab it..

43: Just One word Awesome In Everything !

44: Range is not that great. Its dual band and that's the plus point. Digisol product & service is great having experienced it earlier.

45: I have recently bought this product and not happy with it.Wifi signal is ok but internet connectivity is not good.Faced issue like Skype and iCloud was not working while using these router.

46: Good router having three antennas but should be ADSL

47: Stopped working in 15 days.

48: Don't even buy it by mistake. I have bought this from a retailer and yesterday was the first use. My connection speed is 40mbps but it was giving max 25mbps on wifi. I configured my old Huawei router and it was giving full 40mbps on wifi. I had purchased a Digisol DG-WN3300N wireless USB adapter in the past and it stopped working then I replaced it but it also stopped working

49: DELIVERY and PACKAGING:The product came in a bubble wrapped amazon pack.IN THE PACK:A Digisol router BoxIN THE BOX:- A black router- Power adapter- LAN Cable- ManualSUMMARY:Earlier I was using an ASUS single antenna router which was working great till it went bad and stopped working. I took this as an opportunity to upgrade to a high range router. The ASUS router was good but the speeds reduced after a distance.While looking for all the options I came across a not so famous brand Digisol. Looking in the company details I found that this is an Indian brand with a good reputation in the Hardware sector. Since the price was comparable I went ahead and bought the HR3300TA router.REVIEW:The main unit looks great in the matt finish. It is way better than the normal white or black routers that are available in the market. When you switch on router and the first thing you notice is that the lights on the router are blue which completely compliments the look. The process to configure is simple and if you know which setting to enter in which screen the setting WAN is breeze.The router settings page are easy to navigate but misses polish. To my surprise when you try to open the page from the mobile there is another UI separate from the PC version which is mobile friendly and worked pretty well.I was a bit disappointed with the Range. The Range is better than the Single antenna router but not as good as 3 Antenna routers. I would say it performs a bit better or may be equal to the 2 Antenna routers in terms of range.The speeds are good. The Wifi Speeds remains consistent no matter how far you are from the router.PROS:- Great Looks.- You get a complimentary LAN cable out of the box.- The WiFi speed remains consistent even when you are far from the router.- Mobile friendly router configuration pages which is not normally seen in other routers.- Product of an Indian company with made in India tag.CONS:- The range is not as good as what you expect from a 3 antenna router but comparable to 2 antenna router.- The router misses on the power button. (This I knew before buying but still went ahead).VERDICT:After using for roughly 20 days I would say I am not completely disappointed buying this. The Range is on the lower side but apart from that the product works great in all the other departments.Please Hit the “YES” button If you found this Review Helpful. It encourages me to inspect more and more products so that you could have only the Right Products

1: Many problems faced after installing done... But easy to use... Signal strength is very strong

2: Very good product the router works perfect and the most important thing i want to say about it is network coverage area of this router is far better than routers of big expensive brands. I had installed it in my cousin's house at third floor and internet connection is available on mobile with 2 bars signal from front area of the building at ground floor .

3: Digisol is a reputed company for modem manufacturer. The product quality is as expected from a reputed company. The price which offered by Amazon is great (Less than Rs.500 from market rate). Delivery is on time. Overall experience is highly satisfied. The service of Amazon is superb that's why I rely on amazon.

4: Very good product. Worth the value for money. This is the second router I am buying from digisol for my parent house as I am fully satisfied with the performance of the first which is working for almost 1 year now with out any issues. I had tried other Chinese vendor product and they used to fail after some months of usage and even after the replacement they continued to fail. This one also gives me the happiness that I am supporting Make In India :)
